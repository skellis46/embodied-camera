# research project grants outline application: moving camera bodies

## proposal

### fields of study

- do these online

### start date

Monday 5 July 2021


### total time to be spent on project by PI (hours per week)

15 hours per week (for 18 months?) = total hours? 

As standard (UKRI), in a year there are
- 220 working days 
- 44 working weeks
- 5 days per week
- 7.5 hours per day
- 37.5 hours per week
- 1650 hours per year

7.5 hours per week (1 day) for 66 weeks
= 495 hours

1.5 days per week for 66 weeks 
= 742.5

15 hours (2 days) per week for 66 weeks
= 990

### abstract

>please provide 100 word synopsis of the proposed research project, suitable for the lay reader

### why the Leverhulme Trust?

>full clear justification for applying to LT, based on understanding of LT's character. This is important. Tips: 1) consult their 'approach to grant making'; 2) don't cut and paste from their site; 3) don't duplicate things I've said elsewhere on application; 4) answer the question; 5) don't just describe the project (there's room for that elsewhere); 6) is trust really best recipient for this application? 

>By contrast, discovery-led research (curiosity-driven or ‘blue-skies’ work) often finds itself being squeezed out, as the demand for ‘relevance’ or ‘impact’ steadily grows. In that context, higher- risk fundamental or speculative inquiry may seem to have little to contribute, beyond a (perhaps) better understanding of our world and ourselves. Outcomes are uncertain. The Trust has a keen appetite for this type of proposal. -- <20191113 - LT Newsletter Sept19 Lo-res.pdf>

- research into tech normally about optimisation, quantitative
- this is experiential (and experimental) qualitative.
- founded in unlikely combination
- part of speculation is in methods and outcomes

"generates new forms of experience"[@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

>used for LT to decide if I have time to do the research
