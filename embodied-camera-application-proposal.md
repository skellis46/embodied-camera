### abstract

>please provide 100 word synopsis of the proposed research project, suitable for the lay reader

There is evidence that our health is diminished by smartphone overuse due to "inattentional blindness":[@hyman_did_2009 p.598] the everyday discrepancy between the movement of our bodies and the location of our attention. The smartphone is an oculo-centric device that determines how we communicate with and see others, and how we want to be seen by others. Therefore, it compromises 

As we connect with the screen, the camera, and with others, we disconnect from our other senses and our environment. Our attention is swallowed by the fourth-screen.

Vision dominates human experience, and the smartphone -- as both screen and mirror -- manages our attention.[@crary_suspensions_2001] As our bodies that are predisposed to perceive and experience the world through movement wander aimlessly, our attention is seized by the oculo-centric smartphone. 


We’ve also become more savvy about how to be seen by others with the smartphone. It is a portal between us and them which is strongly visual oriented to the detriment of other senses.

disconnection between paradox: human bodies are predisposed to perceive and experience the world through movement, while smartphones demand attention through stillness. This research seeks to reconfigure this paradox by expanding the corporeal possibilities of human-smartphone experiences.[^cl3] We will use the body-based expertise of dancers in practice-led fieldwork that explores: 1) how movement and stillness are shaped by smartphones; and 2) how our bodies might help reimagine the habitual use of smartphones. The research aims to deepen understanding and experiential awareness of the inter-relationships between smartphones and movement, vision,[^cl4] proprioception and stillness. 

_I don’t think stillness is the right word to describe what smartphone really do to our bodies and its impact on movement. I feel it is more a problem of attention and disconnection from the body and the environment. So often I see people who are walking in the streets, so who are in movement but who are completely unaware of what’s around them in the environment as they are totally absorbed in their phones. Rather than a problem of stillness I see it more as a problem of attention and presence and disconnection from attention, body, movement and the environment that surrounds us. Also let’s not forget that the other name of the smartphone is the ‘mobile’ phone which also expresses that idea of having a computer on the go and therefore facilitating certain movements of the body while digitally interacting in a way which would not be possible with desktop or laptop computers. For me, there is more something to do with how the smartphone somehow disembody us and reduce/narrow our attention to what we see on the screen. Vision dominates. The mind and body are more acutely separated. We’ve also become more savvy about how to be seen by others with the smartphone. It is a portal between us and them which is strongly visual oriented to the detriment of other senses._ 

[^cl3]: _This is really nice and it is an improvement from the previous abstract which is more in line with what funding bodies will want to see. I wonder if there is a way to emphasize more its importance and need. It would be useful for example to be aware of projects which are successfully combining a somatic reflection of embodiment with dancers in combination with technological innovation or whether they are research projects on technological innovation pointing to the need for more integration of body intelligence._ 

[^cl4]: _Vision comes here as an add-on without much explanation it might be good to make it clearer what is the importance of vision in relation to the smartphone._

### why the Leverhulme Trust?

>full clear justification for applying to LT, based on understanding of LT's character. This is important. Tips: 1) consult their 'approach to grant making'; 2) don't cut and paste from their site; 3) don't duplicate things I've said elsewhere on application; 4) answer the question; 5) don't just describe the project (there's room for that elsewhere); 6) is trust really best recipient for this application? 

>By contrast, discovery-led research (curiosity-driven or ‘blue-skies’ work) often finds itself being squeezed out, as the demand for ‘relevance’ or ‘impact’ steadily grows. In that context, higher- risk fundamental or speculative inquiry may seem to have little to contribute, beyond a (perhaps) better understanding of our world and ourselves. Outcomes are uncertain. The Trust has a keen appetite for this type of proposal. -- <20191113 - LT Newsletter Sept19 Lo-res.pdf>

"generates new forms of experience"[@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

these practices are not used in this way -- as a set of tools to understand contemporary cultural practices

>Research-creation does much more than what the funding agencies had in store for it: it generates new forms of experience; it tremulously stages an encounter for disparate practices, giving them a conduit for collective expression; it hesitantly acknowledges that normative modes of inquiry and containment often are incapable of assessing its value; it generates forms of knowledge that are extralinguistic.

### proposal summary 

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection of our bodies and our smartphones: between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and be connected to our moving bodies.

We live in a "smartphone society".[@ofcom_communications_2017] The smartphone is a hyper-visual and hyper-portable device that is synonymous with its screen and camera. It is always-with-us and always-on, and with it we record what we see, how we want to be seen and what we do, and then we share these video-visions with the people in our lives. The smartphone is both lens and mirror; it shapes our identities and sense of self.[@harkin_my_2020; @chan_exploration_2015] 

In 2016 there were 3.9 billion smartphones globally, and by 2022 there will likely be 6.8 billion.[@barnes_mobile_2019] The smartphone is changing our posture, vision, sleep, movement, parenting and psychology.[@park_effects_2015; @kenney_united_2017; @golebiowski_smartphone_2020; @oh_analysis_2015; @elhai_fear_2016] Smartphones compromise our listening,[@stephanidis_effects_2016] cognitive capacity[@ward_brain_2017] and proprioception.[@alshahrani_impact_2018] Whereas technologies commonly and historically expand our senses,[@davidson_somatics_2013; @kolcio_somatic_2005] smartphones seem to narrow our attention. They produce a phenomenon known as _inattentional blindness_: an impaired capacity to "notice new and distinctive stimuli".[@hyman_did_2009 p.604]

The shrinking of our attention into the screen-camera of the smartphone underpins this research proposal. The project's aims, objectives and methods are derived from the proposition that as our attention is compressed into the smartphone, we become disconnected from the "experience of our bodies", our "inner proprioceptive signals" and our "living processes."[Green, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.111]; and that this growing disconnect between attention and corporeal experience underpins the various ways in which smartphones are changing our lives. 

Movement specialists like dancers train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture.**add refs** Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. At the heart of their work is the desire and capacity to sense and feel the body from the inside through proprioception and kinaesthetic awareness. This _sensate acuity_ -- as if _seeing_ with our whole bodies -- is the hallmark of somatic practices like Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Skinner Releasing Technique.

what can these specialists offer? other ways of being with the device? alternative corporealities, postures, options. corporeal Sensitivity to the device? why would we want this? 


'tools' for speculative exploration into _human experiences with everyday technology_ (expanding corporeal possibilities)
-- what might be "alternate parameters of meaningful activity"[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.107] in the bodily-smartphone 'environment'?


In this research, we speculate that there is productive tension between these two divergent phenomena: the smartphone attention machine as experienced by us all, and the body as experienced by dance movement specialists. In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we propose an experimental point of convergence between the smartphone and the sensorial capabilities of the dancer. what becomes possible? to not limit the functions and experiences of our interface and relationships with these technologies

To the extent that which our experiences are "predetermined or prescribed"[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.110] by technology, in _Moving Camera Bodies_ our proposal is to examine, test and imagine other sensate or felt relationships in our society of smartphones.  

In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we apply a physical and sensate (felt) to hyper-visuality and inattention as expressed through and afforded by the smartphone.

#### Research Aim

The research aims to expand the corporeal and sensate possibilities of human-smartphone experiences, and to deepen understanding of the experiential inter-relationships between smartphones, movement, vision, proprioception and the senses. 


#### research questions

1. _Feeling:_ How does it feel in our bodies -- somatically -- to use a smartphone? 

2. _Limits and adaptation:_ How are movements, postures, gestures and physical experiences limited or facilitated by smartphones? How can movement and somatic practices be adapted and used to generate novel or alternate bodily patterns or habits in relationship to the smartphone? 

3. _Senses and communication:_ The smartphone is both camera (lens) and mirror. It is a device through which we perceive and create ourselves and communicate and interact with the environment and others. 

creates We see ourselves and others through and in it. Senses are about communicate and connect/interact with environment and others around us. How might this hegemonic and physically limited way of _seeing_ be adapted and reconfigured through somatic practices that privilege non-visual senses?

Examine the sensory and communicative possibilities

[^cl6]: _Something that is not so much addressed here is how the smartphone and its mirror quality or rather how we want to be perceived by others and the self-image perspective is affecting how we move with our bodies. There is a separation between what we see and what we feel which potentially (but not necessarily if we work with this in awareness) can disconnect us more from our bodies as there is an externalisation of ourselves in the mirror._

#### objectives

_Feeling:_

_RQ1 Feeling:_

1. capture ethnographic data from movement specialists that create a vocabulary exploring how it feels to use a smartphone
2. survey current sociological (and HCI?) literature that examines experiences of smartphone use

_RQ2 Limits and affordances:_

3. create a series of artistic research practices that use the smartphone and its camera to explore and test bodily-sensorial limits and affordances
4. create audio-visual documentation of these practice-based practices and share online 
5. develop reflective-analytical document that describes the physical experiences (limits and affordances) generated in the practices

_RQ3 Adaptation and Generation:_

6. generate a series of artistic research somatic practices that sensitise our bodies to the smartphone
7. create a set of body-based somatic 'activities' that up-end our moving and bodily relationship to the smartphone
8. create edited audio-visual documentation of these practice-based experiments and share online
9. develop reflective-analytical document that describes the effects of the experimental somatic practices on our corporeal relationship to the smartphone

_RQ4 Non-visual senses:_

10. examine current cross-disciplinary scholarship (anthropology, sociology, psychology, somatic practices, visual culture) to reveal key ideas at the intersection of oculo-centric habitus, photo-visual culture, and non-visual senses (haptic, kinesthetic, proprioceptive, aural)
11. generate a set of artistic research experiments that explore the tension between sensate strategies (e.g. body-based or 'felt' movement practices) and the hyper-visuality of smartphones
12. create edited audio-visual documentation of these practice-based experiments and share online
13. develop reflective-analytical document that explores the intersection of non-visual (corporeal) senses and hyper-visuality 

#### significance

Where are we when we are in screen-time, and where else might we be while using smartphones? Experientially led. 

>the lack of integration becomes abundantly clear when students in my classes comment on how wonderful it feels to "be in my body three times a week." This odd expression occurs with such regularity that I have been forced to confront the obvious question: where are they the rest of the time? This is not simply my own (admittedly old school) belief in the importance of live communication, but is indicative of precisely what Crary pointed out in his analysis of modern attention---a situation where we navigate the world via screens (and think we are technologically astute) even though in the process we become less aware of our full, three-dimensional physicality. When my students say they are happy to _be in their bodies_ three times a week, I believe they are actually referring to a heightened awareness of their own [p.63] proprioception, an important perceptual alternative to our vision, and one that is crucial for dealing with disorientation.[@cooper_albright_how_2019 p.62]

#### methods

- rationale: why this method? what do we get from it? 
    + experiential 
    + understanding through doing (citation/evidence/precedent)
    + what we 'know' through dance practices (ie what dance understand might bring to the project)

"to what extent are our experiences, and consequently the very knowledge by which we live, predetermined or prescribed by the technology itself?"[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.110] -- proposal is to imagine and examine other relationships with this technology. To expand the possibilities of our relationship. 

"heightened awareness of the context, coupled with accountability in action, can be felt as a ‘connection’ to the world."[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.106]
State that inside out, opposite of outside in of smartphone (through vision)


By being drawn _away from our bodies_ the project proposes 

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as camera-objects and our bodies that are built for movement. 

>This split does not simply separate our bodies from our minds and favor mind over body ... [it] removes us from the experience of our bodies and dis- connects us from our own inner proprioceptive signals as well as from our somas and living processes ... there is an active obsession with the body as an objective mechanical entity. As a result we are often numbed to the awareness of internal body messages and the power of our connected selves.[Green, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.111]

- not out of fear (Kolcio, p.109), not because threatened, or wanting to limit the smartphone. but out of sheer curiosity -- 

>I really like this reference to stillness in your abstract – but oddly it does not seem to me to be taken through in your research design.  It is probably just the way I read it, the research design seems to be about moving bodies. -- CW

- improvisation: unforseen. less visual
- Cooper-Albright p.76 - ambiguity of the unknown
- 

Our bodies are built for movement. Human beings -- and the bodies we inhabit -- respond physiologically, biochemically and psychologically to movement. We are also built to be stimulated by -- and respond to -- novelty (write something here in relation to attention economy). A by-product of these stimuli is chronic stillness, or staticity. Needs something here about camera/screen -- and identity.  _Moving Camera Bodies_ 


is ACA’s discussion of “back space” (pp.98-99) (and Bonnie’s BMC work — CQs) useful here?  

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as camera-objects and our bodies that are built for movement. 
problem: to investigate this friction. The friction is cultural; the friction is contemporary; the friction is taking over the world. 

>proprioception, an important perceptual alternative to our vision, and one that is crucial for dealing with disorientation.[@cooper_albright_how_2019 p.62] 

>Connecting bodies to space and people to place, proprioception helps us locate ourselves in the world.[@cooper_albright_how_2019 p.63] 



"[Heidegger] suggests that modern technology is not simply a tool or instrument, but a pervasive cultural epistemological paradigm."[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.110] - then look into enframing.

CL _And what for me is important is that although the camera overemphasizes the importance of the visual, the other senses are present in the use of the visual as it is not just the eyes who records but the whole body. So I think the research in that way is about how we see with all of our body not just the eyes which goes with expanding the corporeal possibilities of human-smartphone experiences._

between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and understand experiences of movement. There is tension here 

Its screen (device as screen) is also a lens. Turned back on ourselves (third-person perspective). Device as screen, device as lens. 


distinguish from the smartphone as object that conveys information, but rather as a physical oculo-centric device that we are physically connected to (that we hold, swipe) -- that we manage through gesture, posture. 


**phone also as saviour to stillness** (fitness, mindfulness) "there's an app for that": https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/3/874 (!) (Sesame Street: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhkxDIr0y2U)



Quantitative and qualitative research on smartphones and our _embodied lives_ has focused on the idea of the quantified self,[@lupton_quantified_2016] and the ways in which "Smartphone Sensing Methods" are able to track social behaviours, physical activity and mobility patterns.[@harari_smartphone_2017] 

focus on "narrating the experience of users"[@galloway_paucity_2020 n.pag.] -- as in the work of Turkle.



CL: _It might be useful to clarify that what is also of interests in this project is the fact that with the smartphone we have a portable camera on us all the time that can record everything we see and that can record us and what we do and share it with others. As well as being a portable camera it is also a mobile computer and phone so the camera and images become a direct way to communicate with each other than just talking or writing._ 

>In particular, people using a cell phone may be less likely to notice new and distinctive stimuli, a phenomenon known as inattentional blindness (Becklen & Cervone, 1983; Mack & Rock, 1998; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Newby & Rock, 1998; Simons, 2000; Simons & Chabris, 1999).[@hyman_did_2009 p.598]

>We found that individuals walking while talking on a cell phone displayed inattentional blindness in a real-world situation. They experienced more difficulty navigating through a complex environment than people in other conditions. They walked slower, weaved more often, and made more direction changes. Finally, they were less likely to acknowledge other individuals and to notice the unicycling clown thus illustrating inattentional blindness.[@hyman_did_2009 p.604]

>One of the most dangerous aspects of cell phone divided attention is that affected individuals remain oblivious to their poor performance. Strayer et al. (2006) reported that cell phone participants were unaware of the conversation’s detrimental effects because the participants felt that they performed fine even though they had just displayed problems (see also Lesch & Hancock, 2004). Similarly, many individuals with whom we have talked feel they can perform divided attention tasks such as using a cell phone and driving. However, we cannot trust these claims because people are not aware of the things they miss because of inattentional blindness. Simons and Chabris (1999) noted that when participants were shown what they had missed because of inattentional blindness, they were surprised that they could have missed it.[@hyman_did_2009 p.605]  

[^cl1]: _What does the research say on this? And where does it come from, that is to say which discipline, which questions are being asked? I’m not familiar with it myself but depending on its content it could be useful to work with or against it._

What types of experiences are generated when the smartphone and its camera are consciously used to inform, disrupt and complicate the corporeal-sensorial possibilities of the body?

2. why does this research need to happen?

are being changed by our use of smartphones, and that these changes are occurring within our capacity to notice them.

Smartphone screens demand attention made possible by chronic stillness, and human bodies are predisposed for movement. _Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research that examines this contradictory situation. The research employs the expertise of dance movement specialists in a series of practical field experiments to examine the ways these contemporary cultural technologies of movement and stillness intersect. The experiments involve applying sensate non-visual movement practices to the hyper-visuality and staticity afforded by the smartphone. The research aims to deepen our understanding of the corporeal inter-relationships between smartphones, vision, proprioception, movement and stillness.

problem: to investigate this friction. The friction is cultural; the friction is contemporary; the friction is taking over the world. 

The smartphone is also more than a technological extension to our body. That is, it is more than something that allows “human beings to see, touch, feel, hear, manipulate and understand what to date has remained invisible to the senses or hidden in matter, the body and the universe”.[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5]
