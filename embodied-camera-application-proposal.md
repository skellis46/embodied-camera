# research project grants outline application: moving camera bodies

## proposal

### fields of study

### start date

Monday 5 July 2021


### total time to be spent on project by PI (hours per week)

11.25 hour per week (1.5 days), for 18 months

### abstract

The smartphone is synonymous with its screen and camera. It determines how we communicate with and see others, and how we want to be seen by others. Smartphones also cause "inattentional blindness",[@hyman_did_2009 p.598] and thereby compromise our sensorial experience of the world. _Moving Camera Bodies_ aims to expand the corporeal possibilities of human-smartphone experiences, and to deepen understanding of the experiential inter-relationships between smartphones, movement and the senses. We will use the body-based expertise of dancers in practice-led fieldwork to explore: 1) alternative physical habits in relation to the smartphone; and 2) new sensory and communicative possibilities for the human-smartphone that are underpinned by the non-visual senses.

### why the Leverhulme Trust?

>full clear justification for applying to LT, based on understanding of LT's character. This is important. Tips: 1) consult their 'approach to grant making'; 2) don't cut and paste from their site; 3) don't duplicate things I've said elsewhere on application; 4) answer the question; 5) don't just describe the project (there's room for that elsewhere); 6) is trust really best recipient for this application? 

Research into how technology affects our bodies and lives is founded on the metaphor of _body as machine_.[@bures_body_2016] This research usually selects mechanistic reductive components of the human body, and its results are are primarily about human optimisation and efficiency. I'm applying to the Leverhulme Trust because _Moving Camera Bodies_ is experimental qualitative research[@denzin_sage_2018] built on an unlikely hunch: that the experience and experiences of movement (dance) specialists might have something complex to add to how we understand the human embodiment of smartphones. 

This research is necessarily speculative in its conception, but also in its methods and outputs. The project's data, outputs and written relfections will be fully open access. Indeed, the entire development of this proposal is openly accessible through a git repository at <https://github.com/skellis46/embodied-camera>.

There is risk in _Moving Camera Bodies_: a project that rather oddly exists between the disciplines of dance and somatic practices and human computer interaction. Where creative artistic research is normally used to pursue the possibilities and limits of those practices, here it is used or applied as a set of tools to understand and expand contemporary cultural human-technology 'practices'. The outputs themselves are planned -- to the extent that is possible before we being -- to reflect this experimentation, and are predicated on the possibility that research-creation "generates forms of knowledge that are extralinguistic".[@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

Herein lies the key reason for my application to the Leverhulme Trust: that I understand human endeavour and culture to be on the cusp of a profoundly different relationship to words, images and the visual. That unless our research practices somehow reflect the hyper-visuality of this technological age and how this is changing the way we are _in our bodies_ then we will miss opportunities to generate data and experiences that "somehow turn up outside the bounds of what was conceivable."[Foster, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.121]

### proposal summary 

We live in a "smartphone society".[@ofcom_communications_2017] The smartphone is a hyper-visual and hyper-portable device that is synonymous with its screen and camera. It is always-with-us and always-on, and with it we record what we do, what we see and how we want to be seen; we then share these video-visions with the people in our lives. The smartphone is both lens and mirror; it shapes our identities and sense of self.[@harkin_my_2020; @chan_exploration_2015] 

In 2016 there were 3.9 billion smartphones globally, and by 2022 there will likely be 6.8 billion.[@barnes_mobile_2019] These devices are changing our posture, vision, sleep, movement, parenting and psychology.[@park_effects_2015; @kenney_united_2017; @golebiowski_smartphone_2020; @oh_analysis_2015; @elhai_fear_2016] They compromise our listening,[@stephanidis_effects_2016] cognitive capacity[@ward_brain_2017] and proprioception.[@alshahrani_impact_2018] Whereas technologies commonly and historically expand our senses,[@davidson_somatics_2013; @kolcio_somatic_2005] smartphones seem to narrow our attention. They produce a phenomenon known as _inattentional blindness_: an impaired capacity to "notice new and distinctive stimuli".[@hyman_did_2009 p.604]

The shrinking of our attention into the screen-camera of the smartphone underpins this research proposal. The project's aims, objectives, methods and team are built on two propositions: i) that as our attention is compressed into the smartphone, we become disconnected from the "experience of our bodies", our "inner proprioceptive signals" and our "living processes;"[Green, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.111] and ii) that this growing split between attention and corporeal awareness underpins the various ways in which smartphones are changing our lives. 

Movement specialists like dancers train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture.[@eddy_brief_2009; @reed_conversation_2018] Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins of the human capacity to be sensitive to the body. At the heart of their work is the desire and capacity to sense and feel the body from the inside through proprioception and kinaesthetic awareness. This _sensate acuity_ -- as if _seeing_ with the whole body -- is the hallmark of somatic practices like Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Skinner Releasing Technique.

In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we propose an experimental and methodological point of convergence between the smartphone and the sensorial capabilities of the dancer. This is to apply a physical and sensate (felt) speculative approach to hyper-visuality and inattention as expressed through and afforded by the smartphone. How might these corporeal specialists change our bodily relationship to the smartphone? To the extent that our experiences are "predetermined or prescribed"[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.110] by technology, in _Moving Camera Bodies_ our proposal is to examine, test and imagine alternative corporealities, postures and sensitivities that expand the functions and experiences of our _embodied_ relationship to smartphones. 

#### research aim

The research aims to expand the corporeal and sensate possibilities of human-smartphone experiences, and to deepen understanding of the experiential inter-relationships between smartphones, movement and the senses.  

#### research questions

1. _RQ1 Feeling:_ How does it feel in our bodies -- somatically -- to use a smartphone? 

2. _RQ2 Limits and adaptation:_ How are movements, postures, gestures and physical experiences limited or facilitated by smartphones? How can dance and somatic practices be adapted and used to generate novel or alternate bodily patterns or habits in relationship to the smartphone? 

3. _RQ3 Senses and communication:_ We perceive and create ourselves and communicate and interact with the environment and others through smartphones. This process of externalising ourselves in the mirror-lens of the smartphone disconnects our visual selves from our feeling (or sensate) selves. What are alternative sensory and communicative possibilities for the body-smartphone nexus that are underpinned by the non-visual senses?


#### objectives

- **these will be shortened and combined into 3 or 4 objectives**

_RQ1 Feeling:_

1. capture ethnographic data from movement specialists that create a vocabulary exploring how it feels to use a smartphone
2. survey current sociological and human computer interaction literature that examines experiences of smartphone use

_RQ2 Limits and adaptation:_

3. create a set of body-based somatic 'activities' that explore and up-end our moving and bodily relationship to the smartphone
4. create edited audio-visual documentation of these practice-based experiments and share online
5. develop reflective-analytical document for the project website that describes the effects of the experimental somatic practices on our corporeal relationship to the smartphone

_RQ3 Senses and communication:_

6. examine current cross-disciplinary scholarship (anthropology, sociology, psychology, somatic practices, visual culture) to reveal key ideas at the intersection of oculo-centric habitus, photo-visual culture, and non-visual senses (haptic, kinesthetic, proprioceptive, aural) **change this so it chimes with methods - update for RQ2 as well**
7. generate a set of artistic research experiments that explore the tension between sensate strategies (e.g. body-based or 'felt' movement practices) and the hyper-visuality of smartphones
8. create edited audio-visual documentation of these practice-based experiments and share online
9. develop reflective-analytical document that explores the intersection of non-visual (corporeal) senses and hyper-visuality 

#### significance

The dance scholar Ann Cooper-Albright describes how students in her dance class tell her so regularly "how wonderful it feels to 'be in my body three times a week,'" that she has had to confront the obvious question: "where are they the rest of the time?"[@cooper_albright_how_2019 p.62] This discrepancy or rupture between attention, senses, the body and digital experience is at the heart of why _Moving Camera Bodies_ is important: 1) the research affords a direct yet experimental investigation into the crucial personal technology of our time; 2) it provides the means to speculate on alternative _embodied_ relationships to smartphones; 3) it has a unique experientially-led method (through physical practices and experiments) with movement experts using smartphones and imagining alternative ways of "being" with them. 

#### methods

These are mixed-methods rooted in the idea that we come to understand through doing.[@ingold_making_2013] The methods place the _experience_ of movement specialists in the foreground: what might their expertise contribute to our sensorial understanding of the human-smartphone nexus? 

We will address _RQ1 Feeling_ through ethnographic interviews and analysis with four dancers/movement experts. The interviews will explore their felt experiences of using smartphones. These ethnographic data will be supplemented with scholarly literature analysis. We will complete fieldwork through artistic research for _RQ2 Limits and adaptation_ and _RQ3 Senses and communication_. The fieldwork will be video documented, and followed by auto-ethnographic reflections and analysis of the field-based experiments. For _RQ2 and 3_ we will also undertake a literature survey and analysis of cross-disciplinary scholarship that examines the senses, movement, and visual communication.

- add how much fieldwork: sessions.

### publication of results

The results of _Moving Camera Bodies_ will be published through traditional and non-traditional methods, and will be Open Access: 

1. Scholarly journal article for International Journal of Screendance that shares and juxtaposes emergent themes from qualitative interviews with key ideas from previous scholarship about relationship between smartphones, attention, movement and senses (_RQ1 feeling_).

2. Interview transcriptions made openly accessible through project website (_RQ1 feeling_).

3. Annotated video lexicon of body gestures, movements and actions that are limited or afforded by the smartphone and its camera. This collection will be recorded, transcribed, organised and uploaded to project website (_RQ2 Limits and adaptation_).

4. Audio-visual document of alternative sensory and communicative possibilities for the body-smartphone (_RQ3 Senses and communication_).

5. Video essay that examines the expanded corporeal and sensate possibilities of human-smartphone experiences as revealed through the research (_RQ2-3_).

6. Project website and blog designed to share key ideas and communicate research understandings as they emerge (_RQ1-3_).
