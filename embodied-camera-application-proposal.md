# research project grants outline application: moving camera bodies

## proposal

### fields of study

- do these online

### start date

Monday 5 July 2021


### total time to be spent on project by PI (hours per week)

15 hours per week (for 18 months?) = total hours? 

As standard (UKRI), in a year there are
- 220 working days 
- 44 working weeks
- 5 days per week
- 7.5 hours per day
- 37.5 hours per week
- 1650 hours per year

7.5 hours per week (1 day) for 66 weeks
= 495 hours

1.5 days per week for 66 weeks 
= 742.5

15 hours (2 days) per week for 66 weeks
= 990

### abstract

>please provide 100 word synopsis of the proposed research project, suitable for the lay reader

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is located at the intersection of our smartphones and our bodies, where there is tension between our bodies that are predisposed for movement, and our smartphone screens that demand attention via chronic stillness. _Moving Camera Bodies_ employs the expertise and imaginations of dance movement specialists in a series of practical field experiments to examine this tension. It applies experimental physical and sensate (non-visual) practices to the hyper-visuality and staticity afforded by the smartphone. The research aims to deepen our understanding of the corporeal inter-relationships between smartphones and vision, proprioception, movement and stillness. 


### why the Leverhulme Trust?

>full clear justification for applying to LT, based on understanding of LT's character. This is important. Tips: 1) consult their 'approach to grant making'; 2) don't cut and paste from their site; 3) don't duplicate things I've said elsewhere on application; 4) answer the question; 5) don't just describe the project (there's room for that elsewhere); 6) is trust really best recipient for this application? 

>By contrast, discovery-led research (curiosity-driven or ‘blue-skies’ work) often finds itself being squeezed out, as the demand for ‘relevance’ or ‘impact’ steadily grows. In that context, higher- risk fundamental or speculative inquiry may seem to have little to contribute, beyond a (perhaps) better understanding of our world and ourselves. Outcomes are uncertain. The Trust has a keen appetite for this type of proposal. -- <20191113 - LT Newsletter Sept19 Lo-res.pdf>

- research into tech normally about optimisation, quantitative
- this is experiential (and experimental) qualitative.
- founded in unlikely combination
- part of speculation is in methods and outcomes

"generates new forms of experience"[@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

these practices are not used in this way -- as a set of tools to understand contemporary cultural practices

### other research commitments 

>used for LT to decide if I have time to do the research 

## proposal summary

>style is for lay reader with a good knowledge of subject area. should include hypotheses to be tested, objectives, significance, methods to be used, details of how results will be published

### proposal summary 

We are glued to our screens. The smart-phone is the _sine qua non_ technological extension to our body. Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our bodies, postures, gestures and movements. The smart-phone is also more than a technological extension to our body. That is, it is more than something that allows "human beings to see, touch, feel, hear, manipulate and understand what to date has remained invisible to the senses or hidden in matter, the body and the universe".[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5] If bodily technologies commonly and historically extend our senses outwards -- centrifugally -- then the smart-phone seems to direct our attention back towards our selves in a more centripetal (or centre-seeking) manner. The smart-phone -- a device characterised by, or synonymous with, its screen -- is both lens and mirror. 

couple of sentences here about what work has been done.

Movement specialists like dancers train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture. Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. At the heart of their work is the desire and capacity to sense and feel the body from the inside through proprioception and kinaesthetic awareness. This _sensate acuity_ is the hallmark of somatic practices like Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Skinner Releasing Technique.  

couple of sentences about relationship of somatics to tech -- focused on what? 

In this research, we speculate that there is productive tension between these two divergent phenomena: the smartphone as experienced by us all, and the body as experienced by dance movement specialists. In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we propose an experimental point of convergence between the smartphone and the sensorial capabilities of the dancer. 

between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and understand experiences of movement. There is tension here 


'tools' for speculative exploration into _human experiences with everyday technology_

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as camera-objects and our bodies that are built for movement. 


In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we apply 




Our bodies are built for movement. Human beings -- and the bodies we inhabit -- respond physiologically, biochemically and psychologically to movement. We are also built to be stimulated by -- and respond to -- novelty (write something here in relation to attention economy). A by-product of these stimuli is chronic stillness, or staticity. Needs something here about camera/screen -- and identity.  _Moving Camera Bodies_ 

#### hypotheses / questions

#### objectives

- to employ the skills, experiences and expertise of dance artist-researchers as 'tools' for speculative exploration into _human experiences with everyday technology_
- to adapt and use experimental movement practices to examine the ways in which the smart-phone limits and affords possibilities for movement, sensing and seeing
- to imagine and communicate new or different body-based relationships to the smart-phone 
- employ dance and somatic practices as a strategy to expand understanding of the role and impact of smart-phone screens on daily life

problem: to investigate this friction. The friction is cultural; the friction is contemporary; the friction is taking over the world.
