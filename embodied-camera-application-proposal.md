# research project grants outline application: moving camera bodies

## proposal

### fields of study

- do these online

### start date

Monday 5 July 2021


### total time to be spent on project by PI (hours per week)

11.25 hour per week (1.5 days), for 18 months

### abstract

The smartphone is synonymous with its screen and camera. It determines how we communicate with and see others, and how we want to be seen by others. Smartphones also cause "inattentional blindness",[@hyman_did_2009 p.598] and thereby compromises our sensorial experience of the world. _Moving Camera Bodies_ aims to expand the corporeal possibilities of human-smartphone experiences, and to deepen understanding of the experiential inter-relationships between smartphones, movement and the senses. We will use the body-based expertise of dancers in practice-led fieldwork to explore: 1) alternative physical habits in relation to the smartphone; and 2) new sensory and communicative possibilities for the human-smartphone that are underpinned by the non-visual senses.

### why the Leverhulme Trust?

>full clear justification for applying to LT, based on understanding of LT's character. This is important. Tips: 1) consult their 'approach to grant making'; 2) don't cut and paste from their site; 3) don't duplicate things I've said elsewhere on application; 4) answer the question; 5) don't just describe the project (there's room for that elsewhere); 6) is trust really best recipient for this application? 

>By contrast, discovery-led research (curiosity-driven or ‘blue-skies’ work) often finds itself being squeezed out, as the demand for ‘relevance’ or ‘impact’ steadily grows. In that context, higher- risk fundamental or speculative inquiry may seem to have little to contribute, beyond a (perhaps) better understanding of our world and ourselves. Outcomes are uncertain. The Trust has a keen appetite for this type of proposal. -- <20191113 - LT Newsletter Sept19 Lo-res.pdf>

- research into tech normally about optimisation, quantitative
- this is experiential (and experimental) qualitative.

"generates new forms of experience"[@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

these practices are not used in this way -- as a set of tools to understand contemporary cultural practices

>Research-creation does much more than what the funding agencies had in store for it: it generates new forms of experience; it tremulously stages an encounter for disparate practices, giving them a conduit for collective expression; it hesitantly acknowledges that normative modes of inquiry and containment often are incapable of assessing its value; it generates forms of knowledge that are extralinguistic.

### proposal summary 

We live in a "smartphone society".[@ofcom_communications_2017] The smartphone is a hyper-visual and hyper-portable device that is synonymous with its screen and camera. It is always-with-us and always-on, and with it we record what we see, how we want to be seen and what we do, and then we share these video-visions with the people in our lives. The smartphone is both lens and mirror; it shapes our identities and sense of self.[@harkin_my_2020; @chan_exploration_2015] 

In 2016 there were 3.9 billion smartphones globally, and by 2022 there will likely be 6.8 billion.[@barnes_mobile_2019] These devices are changing our posture, vision, sleep, movement, parenting and psychology.[@park_effects_2015; @kenney_united_2017; @golebiowski_smartphone_2020; @oh_analysis_2015; @elhai_fear_2016] They compromise our listening,[@stephanidis_effects_2016] cognitive capacity[@ward_brain_2017] and proprioception.[@alshahrani_impact_2018] Whereas technologies commonly and historically expand our senses,[@davidson_somatics_2013; @kolcio_somatic_2005] smartphones seem to narrow our attention. They produce a phenomenon known as _inattentional blindness_: an impaired capacity to "notice new and distinctive stimuli".[@hyman_did_2009 p.604]

The shrinking of our attention into the screen-camera of the smartphone underpins this research proposal. The project's aims, objectives, methods and team are built on the proposition that as our attention is compressed into the smartphone, we become disconnected from the "experience of our bodies", our "inner proprioceptive signals" and our "living processes."[Green, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.111]; and that this growing split between attention and corporeal awareness underpins the various ways in which smartphones are changing our lives. 

Movement specialists like dancers train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture.[@eddy_brief_2009; @reed_conversation_2018] Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins of the human capacity to be sensitive to the body. At the heart of their work is the desire and capacity to sense and feel the body from the inside through proprioception and kinaesthetic awareness. This _sensate acuity_ -- as if _seeing_ with the whole body -- is the hallmark of somatic practices like Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Skinner Releasing Technique.

In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we propose an experimental and methodological point of convergence between the smartphone and the sensorial capabilities of the dancer. This is to apply a physical and sensate (felt) speculative approach to hyper-visuality and inattention as expressed through and afforded by the smartphone. How might these corporeal specialists change our bodily relationship to the smartphone? To the extent that our experiences are "predetermined or prescribed"[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.110] by technology, in _Moving Camera Bodies_ our proposal is to examine, test and imagine alternative corporealities, postures and sensitivities that expand the functions and experiences of our _embodied_ relationship to smartphone technologies. 

#### research aim

The research aims to expand the corporeal and sensate possibilities of human-smartphone experiences, and to deepen understanding of the experiential inter-relationships between smartphones, movement and the senses.  

#### research questions

1. _Feeling:_ How does it feel in our bodies -- somatically -- to use a smartphone? 

2. _Limits and adaptation:_ How are movements, postures, gestures and physical experiences limited or facilitated by smartphones? How can dance and somatic practices be adapted and used to generate novel or alternate bodily patterns or habits in relationship to the smartphone? 

3. _Senses and communication:_ We perceive and create ourselves and communicate and interact with the environment and others through smartphones. This process of externalising ourselves in the mirror-lens of the smartphone disconnects our visual selves from our feeling (or sensate) selves. What are alternative sensory and communicative possibilities for the body-smartphone nexus that are underpinned by the non-visual senses?


#### objectives

- these will be shortened and combined into 3 or 4 objectives

_Feeling:_

_RQ1 Feeling:_

1. capture ethnographic data from movement specialists that create a vocabulary exploring how it feels to use a smartphone
2. survey current sociological and human computer interaction literature that examines experiences of smartphone use

_RQ2 Limits and adaptation:_

3. create a set of body-based somatic 'activities' that explore and up-end our moving and bodily relationship to the smartphone
4. create edited audio-visual documentation of these practice-based experiments and share online
5. develop reflective-analytical document for the project website that describes the effects of the experimental somatic practices on our corporeal relationship to the smartphone

_RQ3 Senses and communication:_

6. examine current cross-disciplinary scholarship (anthropology, sociology, psychology, somatic practices, visual culture) to reveal key ideas at the intersection of oculo-centric habitus, photo-visual culture, and non-visual senses (haptic, kinesthetic, proprioceptive, aural) **change this so it chimes with methods - update for RQ2 as well**
7. generate a set of artistic research experiments that explore the tension between sensate strategies (e.g. body-based or 'felt' movement practices) and the hyper-visuality of smartphones
8. create edited audio-visual documentation of these practice-based experiments and share online
9. develop reflective-analytical document that explores the intersection of non-visual (corporeal) senses and hyper-visuality 

#### significance

The dance scholar Ann Cooper-Albright describes how students in her dance class tell her so regularly "how wonderful it feels to 'be in my body three times a week,'" that she has had to confront the obvious question: "where are they the rest of the time?"[@cooper_albright_how_2019 p.62] This discrepancy or rupture between attention, senses, the body and digital experience is at the heart of why _Moving Camera Bodies_ is important: 1) the research affords a direct yet experimental investigation into the crucial personal technology of our time; 2) it provides the means to speculate on alternative _embodied_ relationships to smartphones; 3) it has a unique experientially-led method (through physical practices and experiments) with movement experts using smartphones and imagining alternative ways of "being" with them. 

#### methods

These are mixed-methods rooted in the idea that we come to understand through doing.[@ingold_making_2013] The methods place the _experience_ of movement specialists in the foreground: what might their expertise contribute to our sensorial understanding of the human-smartphone nexus? 

We will address _RQ1 Feeling_ through ethnographic interviews and analysis with four dancers/movement experts. The interviews will explore their felt experiences of using smartphones. These ethnographic data will be supplemented with scholarly literature analysis. We will complete fieldwork through artistic research for _RQ2 Limits and adaptation_ and _RQ3 Senses and communication_. The fieldwork will be video documented, and followed by auto-ethnographic reflections and analysis of the field-based experiments. For _RQ2 and 3_ we will also undertake a literature survey and analysis of cross-disciplinary scholarship that examines the senses, movement, and visual communication.

### publication of results

The results of _Moving Camera Bodies_ will be published through traditional and non-traditional methods, and will be Open Access: 

1. Scholarly journal article for International Journal of Screendance that shares and juxtaposes key themes from qualitative interviews with key ideas from previous scholarship about relationship between smartphones, attention, movement and senses (_RQ1 feeling_).

2. Interview transcriptions will be openly accessible through project website (_RQ1 feeling_).

3. Annotated video lexicon of body gestures, movements and actions that are limited or afforded by the smartphone and its camera. This collection will be recorded, transcribed, organised and uploaded to project website (_RQ2 Limits and adaptation_).

4. Audio-visual document of alternative sensory and communicative possibilities for the body-smartphone (_RQ3 Senses and communication_).

5. Video essay that examines the expanded corporeal and sensate possibilities of human-smartphone experiences as revealed through the research (_RQ2-3_).

6. Project website and blog designed to share key ideas and communicate research understandings as they emerge (_RQ1-3_).

[^cl6]: _Something that is not so much addressed here is how the smartphone and its mirror quality or rather how we want to be perceived by others and the self-image perspective is affecting how we move with our bodies. There is a separation between what we see and what we feel which potentially (but not necessarily if we work with this in awareness) can disconnect us more from our bodies as there is an externalisation of ourselves in the mirror._

'tools' for speculative exploration into _human experiences with everyday technology_ (expanding corporeal possibilities)
-- what might be "alternate parameters of meaningful activity"[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.107] in the bodily-smartphone 'environment'?


In this research, we speculate that there is productive tension between these two divergent phenomena: the smartphone attention machine as experienced by us all, and the body as experienced by dance movement specialists. 


_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection of our bodies and our smartphones: between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and be aware of our moving bodies.



_I don’t think stillness is the right word to describe what smartphone really do to our bodies and its impact on movement. I feel it is more a problem of attention and disconnection from the body and the environment. So often I see people who are walking in the streets, so who are in movement but who are completely unaware of what’s around them in the environment as they are totally absorbed in their phones. Rather than a problem of stillness I see it more as a problem of attention and presence and disconnection from attention, body, movement and the environment that surrounds us. Also let’s not forget that the other name of the smartphone is the ‘mobile’ phone which also expresses that idea of having a computer on the go and therefore facilitating certain movements of the body while digitally interacting in a way which would not be possible with desktop or laptop computers. For me, there is more something to do with how the smartphone somehow disembody us and reduce/narrow our attention to what we see on the screen. Vision dominates. The mind and body are more acutely separated. We’ve also become more savvy about how to be seen by others with the smartphone. It is a portal between us and them which is strongly visual oriented to the detriment of other senses._ 

[^cl3]: _This is really nice and it is an improvement from the previous abstract which is more in line with what funding bodies will want to see. I wonder if there is a way to emphasize more its importance and need. It would be useful for example to be aware of projects which are successfully combining a somatic reflection of embodiment with dancers in combination with technological innovation or whether they are research projects on technological innovation pointing to the need for more integration of body intelligence._ 

The smartphone is an oculo-centric device that determines . Therefore, it compromises 

As we connect with the screen, the camera, and with others, we disconnect from our other senses and our environment. Our attention is swallowed by the fourth-screen.

Vision dominates human experience, and the smartphone -- as both screen and mirror -- manages our attention.[@crary_suspensions_2001] As our bodies that are predisposed to perceive and experience the world through movement wander aimlessly, our attention is seized by the oculo-centric smartphone.

narrow our attention, and there is an increasingly normalised discrepancy between the constricted location of our attention and our experiential location in the world: between our moving bodies and our attention. 



"to what extent are our experiences, and consequently the very knowledge by which we live, predetermined or prescribed by the technology itself?"[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.110] -- proposal is to imagine and examine other relationships with this technology. To expand the possibilities of our relationship. 

"heightened awareness of the context, coupled with accountability in action, can be felt as a ‘connection’ to the world."[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.106]

By being drawn _away from our bodies_ the project proposes 

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as camera-objects and our bodies that are built for movement. 

>This split does not simply separate our bodies from our minds and favor mind over body ... [it] removes us from the experience of our bodies and dis- connects us from our own inner proprioceptive signals as well as from our somas and living processes ... there is an active obsession with the body as an objective mechanical entity. As a result we are often numbed to the awareness of internal body messages and the power of our connected selves.[Green, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.111]

- not out of fear (Kolcio, p.109), not because threatened, or wanting to limit the smartphone. but out of sheer curiosity -- 

>I really like this reference to stillness in your abstract – but oddly it does not seem to me to be taken through in your research design.  It is probably just the way I read it, the research design seems to be about moving bodies. -- CW

Our bodies are built for movement. Human beings -- and the bodies we inhabit -- respond physiologically, biochemically and psychologically to movement. We are also built to be stimulated by -- and respond to -- novelty (write something here in relation to attention economy). A by-product of these stimuli is chronic stillness, or staticity. Needs something here about camera/screen -- and identity.  _Moving Camera Bodies_

CL _And what for me is important is that although the camera overemphasizes the importance of the visual, the other senses are present in the use of the visual as it is not just the eyes who records but the whole body. So I think the research in that way is about how we see with all of our body not just the eyes which goes with expanding the corporeal possibilities of human-smartphone experiences._

Quantitative and qualitative research on smartphones and our _embodied lives_ has focused on the idea of the quantified self,[@lupton_quantified_2016] and the ways in which "Smartphone Sensing Methods" are able to track social behaviours, physical activity and mobility patterns.[@harari_smartphone_2017] 

focus on "narrating the experience of users"[@galloway_paucity_2020 n.pag.] -- as in the work of Turkle.



CL: _It might be useful to clarify that what is also of interests in this project is the fact that with the smartphone we have a portable camera on us all the time that can record everything we see and that can record us and what we do and share it with others. As well as being a portable camera it is also a mobile computer and phone so the camera and images become a direct way to communicate with each other than just talking or writing._ 

>In particular, people using a cell phone may be less likely to notice new and distinctive stimuli, a phenomenon known as inattentional blindness (Becklen & Cervone, 1983; Mack & Rock, 1998; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Newby & Rock, 1998; Simons, 2000; Simons & Chabris, 1999).[@hyman_did_2009 p.598]

>We found that individuals walking while talking on a cell phone displayed inattentional blindness in a real-world situation. They experienced more difficulty navigating through a complex environment than people in other conditions. They walked slower, weaved more often, and made more direction changes. Finally, they were less likely to acknowledge other individuals and to notice the unicycling clown thus illustrating inattentional blindness.[@hyman_did_2009 p.604]

>One of the most dangerous aspects of cell phone divided attention is that affected individuals remain oblivious to their poor performance. Strayer et al. (2006) reported that cell phone participants were unaware of the conversation’s detrimental effects because the participants felt that they performed fine even though they had just displayed problems (see also Lesch & Hancock, 2004). Similarly, many individuals with whom we have talked feel they can perform divided attention tasks such as using a cell phone and driving. However, we cannot trust these claims because people are not aware of the things they miss because of inattentional blindness. Simons and Chabris (1999) noted that when participants were shown what they had missed because of inattentional blindness, they were surprised that they could have missed it.[@hyman_did_2009 p.605]  

[^cl1]: _What does the research say on this? And where does it come from, that is to say which discipline, which questions are being asked? I’m not familiar with it myself but depending on its content it could be useful to work with or against it._

are being changed by our use of smartphones, and that these changes are occurring within our capacity to notice them.

Smartphone screens demand attention made possible by chronic stillness, and human bodies are predisposed for movement. _Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research that examines this contradictory situation. The research employs the expertise of dance movement specialists in a series of practical field experiments to examine the ways these contemporary cultural technologies of movement and stillness intersect. The experiments involve applying sensate non-visual movement practices to the hyper-visuality and staticity afforded by the smartphone. The research aims to deepen our understanding of the corporeal inter-relationships between smartphones, vision, proprioception, movement and stillness.

The smartphone is also more than a technological extension to our body. That is, it is more than something that allows “human beings to see, touch, feel, hear, manipulate and understand what to date has remained invisible to the senses or hidden in matter, the body and the universe”.[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5]
