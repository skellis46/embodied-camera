Moving Camera Bodies: Attention, Embodiment and Smartphones

## proposal

### fields of study

### start date

Monday 5 July 2021


### total time to be spent on project by PI (hours per week)

11.25 hours per week (1.5 days), for 18 months = 100 days

### abstract (93/100)

The screen and camera of a smartphone determine how we communicate with and see others, and how we want to be seen by others. Smartphones also cause "inattentional blindness",[@hyman_did_2009 p.598] and thereby compromise our sensorial experience of the world. _Moving Camera Bodies_ aims to expand the experiential and attentional possibilities between smartphones, the senses and physical movement. We will use the body-based expertise of dancers in practice-led fieldwork to explore: 1) alternative physical habits in relation to the smartphone; and 2) new sensory possibilities for the human-smartphone that are underpinned by the non-visual senses.

### why the Leverhulme Trust? (250 words)

Research into how technology affects our bodies and lives usually focuses on mechanistic reductive components of the human body, and its results are primarily about human optimisation and efficiency. I'm applying to the Leverhulme Trust because _Moving Camera Bodies_ is experimental qualitative research built on a hunch: that the somatic-based expertise and experience of movement specialists can add important sensorial information about the nature of attention to how we understand the human embodiment of smartphones.

This research is speculative in its conception, methods and outputs. There is risk in _Moving Camera Bodies_: a project that exists between the disciplines of dance and somatic practices and human computer interaction. Where artistic research is normally used to pursue the possibilities of arts practices, here it is applied as a tool to understand and expand contemporary cultural human-technology habits. The outputs are planned to reflect this movement and sensory exploration, and are predicated on the possibility that research-creation "generates forms of knowledge that are extralinguistic".[@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

Herein lies the key reason for my application to the Leverhulme Trust: that I understand human endeavour and culture to be on the cusp of a profoundly different relationship to words and images. That unless our research practices somehow reflect the hyper-visuality of this technological age and how this is changing the way we are moving and experiencing our bodies, we will miss opportunities to generate data, experiences and understanding that "turn up outside the bounds of what was conceivable."[Foster, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.121]

### other research commitments 

>used for LT to decide if the PI has time to do the research 

Principal Applicant Ellis is a full-time researcher at the Centre for Dance Research. He has ongoing research projects that take up 20% of his time, and a further 20% is devoted to PhD student supervision, and 10% administration. His remaining time is open to new research projects.

## proposal summary (990/1000)

### research aim

To explore alternative movements, postures and body-based senses that expand our _embodied_ relationship to smartphones. 

### summary 

We live in a "smartphone society".[@ofcom_communications_2017] The smartphone is always-with-us and always-on, and with it we record what we do, what we see and how we want to be seen. Smartphones are shaping our identities and sense of self,[@harkin_my_2020] and changing our posture, vision and movement.[@park_effects_2015; @golebiowski_smartphone_2020] They also compromise our listening,[@stephanidis_effects_2016] cognition[@ward_brain_2017] and proprioception.[@alshahrani_impact_2018] Whereas technologies commonly and historically expand our senses,[@davidson_somatics_2013] smartphones seem to narrow our sensorial attention. They produce a phenomenon known as _inattentional blindness_: an impaired capacity to "notice new and distinctive stimuli".[@hyman_did_2009 p.604]

The shrinking of our attention into the screen-camera of the smartphone underpins the two suppositions of this proposal: i) that as our attention is compressed into the smartphone, we become more disconnected from the "experience of our bodies";[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.111] and ii) the growing split between attention and bodily awareness underpins the ways in which smartphones are changing our lives. 

Dancers trained in somatic practices work to sense and feel the body from the inside through kinaesthetic awareness. This _sensate acuity_ -- as if _seeing_ with the whole body -- is the hallmark of somatic practices like Alexander and Feldenkrais Techniques which are designed to help re-organise the body's sensory-motor neural pathways. In Human Computer Interaction (HCI), there is increasing interest in integrating somatic practices into research to develop more nuanced HCI design.[@hook_designing_2018; @schiphorst_self-evidence_2011] However, _Moving Camera Bodies_ is not a proposal in which somatic practices are used to improve the design of smartphones. Instead, it explores alternative _ways of being_ while using a smartphone by focusing on sensation, attention and bodily awareness.

We propose a methodological point of convergence between the narrowing of human attention while using smartphones and the sensorial capabilities of the somatic practitioner. This is to apply a physical and sensate exploratory approach to hyper-visuality and inattention as generated by the smartphone. How might these somatic dance specialists change our bodily relationship to the smartphone and open new possibilities of interaction which are enhancing body awareness rather than restricting it?

### research questions

1. _RQ1 Feeling:_ How does it feel in our bodies to use a smartphone? 

2. _RQ2 Limits and adaptation:_ How are physical experiences limited or facilitated by smartphones? How can somatic practices be adapted and used to generate broader attention and novel physical habits in relationship to the smartphone? 

3. _RQ3 Non-visual senses:_ What alternative sensory experiences for the body-smartphone-environment nexus are afforded by non-visual senses?

### objectives

_RQ1 Feeling:_

1. capture interview data from somatic specialists to create an expanded vocabulary of how it feels to use a smartphone;
2. survey current sociological and HCI literature examining experiences of smartphone use.

_RQ2 Limits and adaptation:_

3. create a set of body-based somatic 'activities' that expand our corporeal relationship to the smartphone;
4. create and share documentation of these practice-based experiments;
5. develop a reflective-analytical document that describes the effects of the experimental somatic practices on our corporeal relationship to the smartphone.

_RQ3 Non-visual senses:_

6. examine current cross-disciplinary scholarship on non-visual senses in human-technology attention and awareness; 
7. create a set of artistic research experiments that explore the tension between sensate body-based strategies, the surrounding environment and the hyper-visuality of smartphones;
8. create and share documentation of these practice-based experiments into the intersection of non-visual senses and hyper-visuality; develop into collection of functional practices to be made available for use by other researchers and the wider public.
 
### significance

The dance scholar Ann Cooper-Albright describes how students in her dance class tell her so regularly "how wonderful it feels to 'be in my body three times a week,'" that she has had to ask the obvious question: "where are they the rest of the time?"[@cooper_albright_how_2019 p.62] This discrepancy or rupture between attention, senses, the body and digital experience is at the heart of why _Moving Camera Bodies_ is important: 1) the research affords a direct yet exploratory investigation into the crucial personal technology of our time; 2) it provides the means to speculate on alternative _embodied_ relationships to smartphones; 3) it has a unique experientially-led method with somatics experts using smartphones and imagining alternative ways of _being_ with them. 

### methods

These are mixed-methods that place the _experience_ of movement specialists in the foreground. We will address _RQ1 Feeling_ through interviews and analysis with four somatics experts. The interviews will explore their felt experiences of using smartphones. These data will be supplemented with scholarly literature analysis. We will complete fieldwork through artistic research for _RQ2 Limits and adaptation_ and _RQ3 Non-visual senses_. The fieldwork (2 x 3 weeks) will be video documented, and followed by auto-ethnographic reflections and analysis of the field-based experiments. For _RQ2 and 3_ we will also undertake a literature survey and analysis of cross-disciplinary scholarship that examines the senses, movement and visual communication. 

### publication of results

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is exploratory research. We cannot yet know what the outcomes of the method will be. The goal though is to use the experiments to expand how people think and behave towards their smartphones. 

The results of _Moving Camera Bodies_ will be published through traditional and non-traditional methods, and will be Open Access: 1. Scholarly article for International Journal of Screendance that juxtaposes emergent themes from qualitative interviews with key ideas from previous scholarship about relationship between smartphones, attention, movement and senses (_RQ1 feeling_). 2. Interview transcriptions made openly accessible through project website as data for future research (_RQ1 feeling_). 3. Annotated video lexicon of body gestures, movements and actions that are limited or afforded by the smartphone and its camera; recorded, organised and uploaded to project website (_RQ2 Limits and adaptation_). 4. Audio-visual collection of practices derived from alternative sensory experiences for the body-smartphone-environment nexus afforded by the non-visual senses (_RQ3 Non-visual senses_). 5. Video essay that examines the expanded corporeal and sensate possibilities of human-smartphone experiences as revealed through the research (_RQ2-3_). 6. Project website and blog designed to share key ideas and communicate research understandings as they emerge (_RQ1-3_).

### staff resources requested 

Principal Applicant Simon Ellis will work 1.5 days per week for 18 months (100 days). His work will be divided across project management and administration, over-seeing data collection, leading the field experiments, and ensuring project outputs are delivered as planned. He will also provide intellectual leadership and dance and somatics expertise.

Co-applicant Yvonne Rogers is an HCI specialist. She will work 1.5 hours per week for 18 months (13 days). Her primary role will be to support Objective 8: to help transform the knowledge acquired during the fieldwork as part of the development of the collection of practices that speak beyond dance and somatics specialists to the wider public.

Request one RA working 3 days per week for 18 months (200 days). This person will support the project through administrative work, video documentation, data management and project communications. They will also develop their own research expertise by supporting data analysis and writing. 

There will be four consultants: Owa Barua, Katrina McPherson, Natalia Barua and Claire Loussouarn. All four are movement and film specialists working with exploratory methods of integrating technologies and somatic practices. Each brings unique skills and experience: Owa Barua's practice focuses on embodied camera work; McPherson has worked closely with the camera and movement as improvisation; Natalia Barua works to communicate embodied understandings in screendance to the wider public; and Loussouarn is an anthropologist working with technology and somatic practices. Previously PI Ellis has worked with Barua, McPherson and Barua on experimental dance and archival films. The consultants are required as a group of experts capable of completing the experimental creative-research fieldwork under Ellis' leadership. They will provide practical consultation specific to their individual expertise. Each consultant will be employed for 30 days of fieldwork (two periods of three weeks), at £166.67 per day = £5000 each). 


### Contribution of co-applicant (220/250)

Yvonne Rogers is a Professor of Interaction Design, the director of UCLIC and a deputy head of the Computer Science department at University College London. She is interested in how technology transforms what it means to be human. Her work is in the areas of ubiquitous computing, interaction design and human-computer interaction. A central theme of her work is concerned with designing interactive technologies that augment humans. She has been instrumental in promulgating new theories (e.g., external cognition), alternative methodologies (e.g., in the wild studies) and far-reaching research agendas (e.g., "Being Human: HCI in 2020"). She has also published two monographs "HCI Theory: Classical, Modern and Contemporary." and "Research in the Wild." with Paul Marshall. 

Rogers' role in _Moving camera bodies_ will be to help transform the understandings emerging from the fieldwork to develop a collection of practices, strategies and tools that speak beyond dance and somatics specialists to the wider public. Her work in community engagement and collaborative work activities will be key here. She will support Ellis in finding a way to _translate_ and communicate more esoteric body-based practices that can change and expand the ways in which people embody and understand how they use smartphones. Her background in Computer Science will act as an _intellectual foil_ and _supportive challenge_ to Ellis' expertise in body-based research and practice.
