_notes from conversation with Yvonne_

- why am I applying for money? (when I can do this anyway)
    + support colleagues
    + resources to do the work
    + demands of C-DaRE
    + power of somatics and embodied awareness: given resources and kudos, perhaps even respect
- how does it do this -- this work of the body? 
    - the weakness in my argument 
    - attention: sensitising to the world 
    - little empirical understanding of the neuro-mechanical mechanisms of somatic dance: trained senses, particularly touch, proprioception, body in space, muscular tone (tension), alignment, 
- smartphone also has got us moving / also as feedback mechanism
- lure of the smartphone, addiction to these things. 
- where is the impact? 
    - the question of how does this work? 
    - undefined 
    - "work package 1": just the beginning 
    - app by Nadia tied to her back 
    - HCI -- use of YR's time -- translation of this work to other artists. How to transform into value/knowledge for others. HCI, schools, 
    - not in my comfort zone -- interfacing with YR. push through into this other world -- to see how dance/somatics can be used and entered into other discourses. 
    - to stop it being ignored -- to get others to help
- thinking that I'm not trying to improve HCI or UX design. But rather open out how we are with already designed objects; that in doing so we change, deepen, complicate, rethink our relationship to those devices. 

### abstract (91/100)

The smartphone's screen and camera determine how we communicate with and see others, and how we want to be seen by others. Smartphones also cause "inattentional blindness",[@hyman_did_2009 p.598] and thereby compromise our sensorial experience of the world. _Moving Camera Bodies_ aims to expand the experiential possibilities between smartphones, movement and the senses. We will use the body-based expertise of dancers in practice-led fieldwork to explore: 1) alternative physical habits in relation to the smartphone; and 2) new sensory possibilities for the human-smartphone that are underpinned by the non-visual senses.

### why the Leverhulme Trust?

Research into how technology affects our bodies and lives has typically focused on the metaphor of _body as machine_.[@bures_body_2016] This research usually selects mechanistic reductive components of the human body, and its results are primarily about human optimisation and efficiency. I'm applying to the Leverhulme Trust because _Moving Camera Bodies_ is experimental qualitative research[@denzin_sage_2018] built on a hunch: that the experience and experiences of movement (dance) specialists have something complex to add to how we understand the human embodiment of smartphones. 

This research is speculative in its conception, but also in its methods and outputs. The project's data, outputs and written reflections will be fully open access. Indeed, the entire development of this proposal is openly accessible through a git repository at <https://github.com/skellis46/embodied-camera>.

There is risk in _Moving Camera Bodies_: a project that rather oddly exists between the disciplines of dance and somatic practices and human computer interaction. Where creative artistic research is normally used to pursue the possibilities and limits of those practices, here it is used or applied as a set of tools to understand and expand contemporary cultural human-technology 'practices'. The outputs themselves are planned -- to the extent that is possible before we begin -- to reflect this exploration, and are predicated on the possibility that research-creation "generates forms of knowledge that are extralinguistic".[@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

Herein lies the key reason for my application to the Leverhulme Trust: that I understand human endeavour and culture to be on the cusp of a profoundly different relationship to words, images and the visual. That unless our research practices somehow reflect the hyper-visuality of this technological age and how this is changing the way we are _in our bodies_ then we will miss opportunities to generate data and experiences that "somehow turn up outside the bounds of what was conceivable."[Foster, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.121]

## proposal summary (998/1000)

### research aim

The research aims to expand the corporeal and sensate possibilities of human-smartphone experiences, and to deepen understanding of the experiential inter-relationships between smartphones, movement and the senses.  

### summary 

We live in a "smartphone society".[@ofcom_communications_2017] The smartphone is always-with-us and always-on, and with it we record what we do, what we see and how we want to be seen. Smartphones are shaping our identities and sense of self,[@harkin_my_2020] and changing our posture, vision, sleep and movement.[@park_effects_2015; @golebiowski_smartphone_2020; @oh_analysis_2015] They also compromise our listening,[@stephanidis_effects_2016] cognitive capacity[@ward_brain_2017] and proprioception.[@alshahrani_impact_2018] Whereas technologies commonly and historically expand our senses,[@davidson_somatics_2013] smartphones seem to narrow our attention. They produce a phenomenon known as _inattentional blindness_: an impaired capacity to "notice new and distinctive stimuli".[@hyman_did_2009 p.604]

The shrinking of our attention into the screen-camera of the smartphone underpins the two suppositions on which this proposal is built: i) that as our attention is compressed into the smartphone, we become disconnected from the "experience of our bodies";[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.111] and ii) that this growing split between attention and bodily awareness underpins the ways in which smartphones are changing our lives. 

Dancers trained in somatic practices work to sense and feel the body from the inside through proprioception and kinaesthetic awareness. This _sensate acuity_ -- as if _seeing_ with the whole body -- is the hallmark of somatic practices like Alexander Technique and Feldenkrais. In Human Computer Interaction (HCI), there is increasing interest in integrating somatic practices into research design processes to develop more nuanced HCI design.[@hook_designing_2018; @schiphorst_self-evidence_2011] However, _Moving Camera Bodies_ is not a proposal in which somatic practices are used to somehow improve the design of smartphones. Instead, it explores alternative _ways of being_ while using a smartphone by focusing on sensation, attention and bodily awareness. 

We propose a methodological point of convergence between the smartphone and the sensorial capabilities of the somatic practitioner. This is to apply a physical and sensate (felt) speculative approach to hyper-visuality and inattention as expressed through and afforded by the smartphone. How might these somatic dance specialists change our bodily relationship to the smartphone? In _Moving Camera Bodies_ our proposal is to imagine and examine alternative corporealities, postures and sensitivities that expand the experiences of our _embodied_ relationship to smartphones.


### research questions

1. _RQ1 Feeling:_ How does it feel in our bodies -- somatically -- to use a smartphone? 

2. _RQ2 Limits and adaptation:_ How are physical experiences limited or facilitated by smartphones? How can somatic practices be adapted and used to generate novel physical patterns or habits in relationship to the smartphone? 

3. _RQ3 Non-visual senses:_ What are alternative sensory experiences for the body-smartphone nexus afforded by the non-visual senses?

### objectives

_RQ1 Feeling:_

1. capture ethnographic data from movement specialists to create an expanded vocabulary of how it feels to use a smartphone
2. survey current sociological and HCI literature that examines experiences of smartphone use

_RQ2 Limits and adaptation:_

3. create a set of body-based somatic 'activities' that expand our body-based relationship to the smartphone
4. create and share video documentation of these practice-based experiments
5. develop reflective-analytical document that describes the effects of the experimental somatic practices on our corporeal relationship to the smartphone

_RQ3 Non-visual senses:_

6. examine current cross-disciplinary scholarship into role of non-visual senses in human-technology attention and awareness 
7. create a set of artistic research experiments that explore the tension between sensate strategies (body-based or 'felt' movement practices) and the hyper-visuality of smartphones
8. create and share video documentation of these practice-based experiments
9. develop reflective-analytical document that explores the intersection of non-visual senses and hyper-visuality 
 
### significance

The dance scholar Ann Cooper-Albright describes how students in her dance class tell her so regularly "how wonderful it feels to 'be in my body three times a week,'" that she has had to ask the obvious question: "where are they the rest of the time?"[@cooper_albright_how_2019 p.62] This discrepancy or rupture between attention, senses, the body and digital experience is at the heart of why _Moving Camera Bodies_ is important: 1) the research affords a direct yet exploratory investigation into the crucial personal technology of our time; 2) it provides the means to speculate on alternative _embodied_ relationships to smartphones; 3) it has a unique experientially-led method (through physical practices and experiments) with somatics experts using smartphones and imagining alternative ways of "being" with them. 

### methods

These are mixed-methods that place the _experience_ of movement specialists in the foreground. We will address _RQ1 Feeling_ through ethnographic interviews and analysis with four somatics experts. The interviews will explore their felt experiences of using smartphones. These ethnographic data will be supplemented with scholarly literature analysis. We will complete fieldwork through artistic research for _RQ2 Limits and adaptation_ and _RQ3 Non-visual senses_. The fieldwork (2 x 3 weeks) will be video documented, and followed by auto-ethnographic reflections and analysis of the field-based experiments. For _RQ2 and 3_ we will also undertake a literature survey and analysis of cross-disciplinary scholarship that examines the senses, movement, and visual communication. 

### publication of results

The results of _Moving Camera Bodies_ will be published through traditional and non-traditional methods, and will be Open Access: 1. Scholarly article for International Journal of Screendance that juxtaposes emergent themes from qualitative interviews with key ideas from previous scholarship about relationship between smartphones, attention, movement and senses (_RQ1 feeling_). 2. Interview transcriptions made openly accessible through project website as data for future research (_RQ1 feeling_). 3. Annotated video lexicon of body gestures, movements and actions that are limited or afforded by the smartphone and its camera; recorded, organised and uploaded to project website (_RQ2 Limits and adaptation_). 4. Audio-visual document of alternative sensory experiences for the body-smartphone nexus afforded by the non-visual senses (_RQ3 Non-visual senses_). 5. Video essay that examines the expanded corporeal and sensate possibilities of human-smartphone experiences as revealed through the research (_RQ2-3_). 6. Project website and blog designed to share key ideas and communicate research understandings as they emerge (_RQ1-3_).

PI Simon Ellis will work 1.5 days per week for 18 months (approximately 100 days). His work will be divided across project management and administration, over-seeing data collection, leading the field experiments, and ensuring project outputs are delivered as planned.

Co-applicant Yvonne Rogers is an HCI specialist. She will work 1.5 hours per week for 18 months (approximately 13 days). Her primary role will be to help transform the knowledge acquired during the fieldwork, and develop outputs that speak beyond dance and somatics specialists to the wider public.

There will be one RA working at 2.5 days per week for 18 months (approximately 167 days). This person's role will be to support the project through administrative work, research support, video documentation, data management and project communications.

There will be four consultants: Owa Barua, Katrina McPherson, Natalia Barua and Claire Loussouarn. All four are movement and film specialists working with exploratory methods of integrating technologies and somatic practices. Previously PI Ellis has worked with Barua, McPherson and Barua on experimental dance and archival films. Loussouarn is an artist-researcher working in somatic practices in relation to screens. Together their role will be to participate in and provide practical consultation on the creative-research field work. They will be employed for 30 days (two periods of three weeks), budgeted at £166.67 per day = £5000 each).
