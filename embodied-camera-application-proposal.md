Monday 5 July 2021


### total time to be spent on project by PI (hours per week)

15 hours per week (for 18 months?) = total hours? 

As standard (UKRI), in a year there are
- 220 working days 
- 44 working weeks
- 5 days per week

### abstract

>please provide 100 word synopsis of the proposed research project, suitable for the lay reader

Smartphone screens demand attention made possible by chronic stillness, and human bodies are predisposed for movement. _Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research that examines this contradictory situation. The research employs the expertise of dance movement specialists in a series of practical field experiments to examine the ways these contemporary cultural technologies of movement and stillness intersect. The experiments involve applying sensate non-visual movement practices to the hyper-visuality and staticity afforded by the smartphone. The research aims to deepen our understanding of the corporeal inter-relationships between smartphones, vision, proprioception, movement and stillness. 

### why the Leverhulme Trust?

>full clear justification for applying to LT, based on understanding of LT's character. This is important. Tips: 1) consult their 'approach to grant making'; 2) don't cut and paste from their site; 3) don't duplicate things I've said elsewhere on application; 4) answer the question; 5) don't just describe the project (there's room for that elsewhere); 6) is trust really best recipient for this application? 

>By contrast, discovery-led research (curiosity-driven or ‘blue-skies’ work) often finds itself being squeezed out, as the demand for ‘relevance’ or ‘impact’ steadily grows. In that context, higher- risk fundamental or speculative inquiry may seem to have little to contribute, beyond a (perhaps) better understanding of our world and ourselves. Outcomes are uncertain. The Trust has a keen appetite for this type of proposal. -- <20191113 - LT Newsletter Sept19 Lo-res.pdf>

- research into tech normally about optimisation, quantitative
- this is experiential (and experimental) qualitative.
- founded in unlikely combination
- part of speculation is in methods and outcomes

"generates new forms of experience"[@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

these practices are not used in this way -- as a set of tools to understand contemporary cultural practices

>Research-creation does much more than what the funding agencies had in store for it: it generates new forms of experience; it tremulously stages an encounter for disparate practices, giving them a conduit for collective expression; it hesitantly acknowledges that normative modes of inquiry and containment often are incapable of assessing its value; it generates forms of knowledge that are extralinguistic. [@manning_minor_2016 p.27]

### other research commitments 

>used for LT to decide if I have time to do the research

### proposal summary 

We are glued to our screens. In 2016 there were **3.xx billion** smartphones globally, and it is estimated that by 2022 there will be 6.8 billion.[@barnes_mobile_2019] The smartphone is the _sine qua non_ technological extension to our body. Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our posture, vision, sleep, movement and psychological states.[@park_effects_2015; @kenney_united_2017; @golebiowski_smartphone_2020; @oh_analysis_2015; @elhai_fear_2016] If bodily technologies commonly and historically extend our senses outwards or centrifugally,[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5] then the smartphone seems to direct our attention centripetally towards our inner selves. The smartphone -- a device characterised by, or synonymous with, its screen -- is both lens and mirror, and its pleasure and power is at least in part made possible by how its hyper-visual worlds shape our identities.**add ref about identity** 

couple of sentences here about what work has been done: previous work focused on effects of smartphones on our bodies, vision. 

Movement specialists like dancers train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture.**refs** Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. At the heart of their work is the desire and capacity to sense and feel the body from the inside through proprioception and kinaesthetic awareness. This _sensate acuity_ is the hallmark of somatic practices like Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Skinner Releasing Technique. 

State that inside out, opposite of outside in of smartphone

couple of sentences about relationship of somatics to tech -- focused on what? 

In this research, we speculate that there is productive tension between these two divergent phenomena: the smartphone as experienced by us all, and the body as experienced by dance movement specialists. In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we propose an experimental point of convergence between the smartphone and the sensorial capabilities of the dancer. 

between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and understand experiences of movement. There is tension here 

Its screen (device as screen) is also a lens. Turned back on ourselves (third-person perspective). Device as screen, device as lens. 


screens today are "methods for the management of attention that use partitioning and sedentarization, rndering bodies controllable and useful simultaneously, even as they simular the illusion of choices and 'interactivity'"[@crary_suspensions_2001 p.75]

>proprioception, an important perceptual alternative to our vision, and one that is crucial for dealing with disorientation.[@cooper-albright_how_2019 p.62] 

>Connecting bodies to space and people to place, proprioception helps us locate ourselves in the world.[@cooper-albright_how_2019 p.63] 

'tools' for speculative exploration into _human experiences with everyday technology_

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as camera-objects and our bodies that are built for movement. 

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection of our bodies and our smartphones: between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and understand experiences of movement; between hyper-visuality and the sensate or felt; between our flesh and our device-objects; between the body and data.

In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we apply 


Our bodies are built for movement. Human beings -- and the bodies we inhabit -- respond physiologically, biochemically and psychologically to movement. We are also built to be stimulated by -- and respond to -- novelty (write something here in relation to attention economy). A by-product of these stimuli is chronic stillness, or staticity. Needs something here about camera/screen -- and identity.  _Moving Camera Bodies_ 

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as camera-objects and our bodies that are built for movement. 
problem: to investigate this friction. The friction is cultural; the friction is contemporary; the friction is taking over the world. 

In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we apply a physical and sensate -- and thereby mostly unseeing -- lens to hyper-visuality and staticity as expressed through and afforded by the smartphone.

Aims: 

- to employ the skills, experiences and expertise of dance artist-researchers as 'tools' for speculative exploration into _human experiences with everyday technology_
- to adapt and use experimental movement practices to examine the ways in which the smartphone limits and affords possibilities for movement, sensing and seeing
- to imagine and communicate new or different body-based relationships to the smartphone 
- employ dance and somatic practices as a strategy to expand understanding of the role and impact of smartphone screens on daily life

#### hypotheses / questions

1. How does it feel somatically -- in our bodies -- to use a smartphone? 
    
+ analysis of literature examining impact of smartphone use with and on our bodies
+ ethnographic interviews with four dancers/movement experts exploring their felt experiences of using smartphones
+ analysis of transcriptions from interviews to tease out key themes 
+ upload interview transcriptions online as OA resource
+ develop scholarly article that shares and juxtaposes key themes from interviews with key ideas from previous scholarship about relationship between smartphones and our bodies

2. What movements, postures, gestures and physical _attitudes_ does the smartphone limit and afford? What types of experiences are generated when the smartphone and its camera are consciously used to inform, disrupt and complicate the corporeal-sensorial possibilities of the body? 

+ complete practice-research fieldwork to create lexicon of body-based limits and affordances in relation to smartphone 
+ use practice-research to experiment with the smartphone and its camera as a source for body-based understandings and experiences
+ transcribe/record these experiments and share online

3. How can movement and somatic practices be adapted and used to generate novel or alternate bodily patterns or habits in relationship to the smartphone? 

+ use practice-research fieldwork to generate series of practices that sensitise our bodies to the smartphone
+ use practice-research fieldwork to create a set of body-based 'activities' that up-end our moving and bodily relationship to the smartphone

4. The smartphone is both camera (lens) and mirror. We see ourselves and others through and in it. How might this dominant and physically restricted cultural way of _seeing_ be adapted and reconfigured through somatic practices that privilege non-visual senses?

+ examine current cross-disciplinary scholarship (anthropology, sociology, psychology, somatic practices, visual culture) to reveal key ideas at the intersection of oculo-centric habitus, photo-visual culture, and non-visual senses (haptic, kinesthetic, proprioceptive, aural)
+ use creative practice-research experimentation to examine the friction or tension generated by using sensate (or body-based 'felt') strategies to explore the hyper-visuality of smartphone culture

#### objectives





#### significance

#### methods

- break down according to research questions
- 
- literature/field review and analysis 
- fieldwork
    + ethnographic interviews on subject of smartphones and our moving bodies (with artists and scholars)
        * artist who made sculptures of hands (gestures)
    + experimental workshops as research space/environment
    + experimental practice-research (with KM, OB, NB, CL): 
        * experiments in screen-based anti/non/-movement
        * combining first-person and third-person cameras (phone and go-pro mounted with gnarwhal)
- rationale: why this method? what do we get from it? 
    + experiential 
    + understanding through doing (citation/evidence/precedent)
    + what we 'know' through dance practices (ie what dance understand might bring to the project)

experimental qualitative research methods: 

#### publication of results

- develop range of public facing (including non-traditional) research outputs
- develop various writing practices (blog posting and traditional scholarship) that share key (emergent) ideas and communicate research understandings 
- something about aesthetic, process-orientated (through creative practice), experiential and ethnographic 

1. Develop (ready for publication) a scholarly article examining how it feels to use a smartphone
2. _smartphone and its camera's effects on the body:_ create annotated video lexicon of body gestures, actions and possibilities that are limited or afforded by the smartphone and its camera (use MotionBank?). This collection will be recorded, transcribed, organised and uploaded to project website
3. _body's effects on the camera:_ generate a series of body-based practices or activities that question, expand and transform our conventional corporeal relationship to the smartphone. This collection will be recorded, transcribed, organised and uploaded to the project website
4. artistic output - screendance (coming from RQ 2 and 3)
5. non-visual senses. creative possibilities of device as camera and the body (intersection) possibly use footage or stills from interviews as well? - visual essay
6. project website, including project blog

problem: to investigate this friction. The friction is cultural; the friction is contemporary; the friction is taking over the world. 

The smartphone is also more than a technological extension to our body. That is, it is more than something that allows “human beings to see, touch, feel, hear, manipulate and understand what to date has remained invisible to the senses or hidden in matter, the body and the universe”.[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5]
