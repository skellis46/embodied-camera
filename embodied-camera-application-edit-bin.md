We perceive and create ourselves and communicate and interact with the environment and others through smartphones. This process of externalising ourselves in the mirror-lens of the smartphone disconnects our visual selves from our feeling (or sensate) selves.

>Research-creation does much more than what the funding agencies had in store for it: it generates new forms of experience; it tremulously stages an encounter for disparate practices, giving them a conduit for collective expression; it hesitantly acknowledges that normative modes of inquiry and containment often are incapable of assessing its value; it generates forms of knowledge that are extralinguistic.

[^cl6]: _Something that is not so much addressed here is how the smartphone and its mirror quality or rather how we want to be perceived by others and the self-image perspective is affecting how we move with our bodies. There is a separation between what we see and what we feel which potentially (but not necessarily if we work with this in awareness) can disconnect us more from our bodies as there is an externalisation of ourselves in the mirror._

In this research, we speculate that there is productive tension between these two divergent phenomena: the smartphone attention machine as experienced by us all, and the body as experienced by dance movement specialists. 


_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection of our bodies and our smartphones: between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and be aware of our moving bodies.



_I don’t think stillness is the right word to describe what smartphone really do to our bodies and its impact on movement. I feel it is more a problem of attention and disconnection from the body and the environment. So often I see people who are walking in the streets, so who are in movement but who are completely unaware of what’s around them in the environment as they are totally absorbed in their phones. Rather than a problem of stillness I see it more as a problem of attention and presence and disconnection from attention, body, movement and the environment that surrounds us. Also let’s not forget that the other name of the smartphone is the ‘mobile’ phone which also expresses that idea of having a computer on the go and therefore facilitating certain movements of the body while digitally interacting in a way which would not be possible with desktop or laptop computers. For me, there is more something to do with how the smartphone somehow disembody us and reduce/narrow our attention to what we see on the screen. Vision dominates. The mind and body are more acutely separated. We’ve also become more savvy about how to be seen by others with the smartphone. It is a portal between us and them which is strongly visual oriented to the detriment of other senses._ 

[^cl3]: _This is really nice and it is an improvement from the previous abstract which is more in line with what funding bodies will want to see. I wonder if there is a way to emphasize more its importance and need. It would be useful for example to be aware of projects which are successfully combining a somatic reflection of embodiment with dancers in combination with technological innovation or whether they are research projects on technological innovation pointing to the need for more integration of body intelligence._ 

The smartphone is an oculo-centric device that determines . Therefore, it compromises 

As we connect with the screen, the camera, and with others, we disconnect from our other senses and our environment. Our attention is swallowed by the fourth-screen.

Vision dominates human experience, and the smartphone -- as both screen and mirror -- manages our attention.[@crary_suspensions_2001] As our bodies that are predisposed to perceive and experience the world through movement wander aimlessly, our attention is seized by the oculo-centric smartphone.

narrow our attention, and there is an increasingly normalised discrepancy between the constricted location of our attention and our experiential location in the world: between our moving bodies and our attention. 



"to what extent are our experiences, and consequently the very knowledge by which we live, predetermined or prescribed by the technology itself?"[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.110] -- proposal is to imagine and examine other relationships with this technology. To expand the possibilities of our relationship. 

"heightened awareness of the context, coupled with accountability in action, can be felt as a ‘connection’ to the world."[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.106]

By being drawn _away from our bodies_ the project proposes 

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as camera-objects and our bodies that are built for movement. 

>This split does not simply separate our bodies from our minds and favor mind over body ... [it] removes us from the experience of our bodies and dis- connects us from our own inner proprioceptive signals as well as from our somas and living processes ... there is an active obsession with the body as an objective mechanical entity. As a result we are often numbed to the awareness of internal body messages and the power of our connected selves.[Green, in @kolcio_somatic_2005 p.111]

- not out of fear (Kolcio, p.109), not because threatened, or wanting to limit the smartphone. but out of sheer curiosity -- 

>I really like this reference to stillness in your abstract – but oddly it does not seem to me to be taken through in your research design.  It is probably just the way I read it, the research design seems to be about moving bodies. -- CW

Our bodies are built for movement. Human beings -- and the bodies we inhabit -- respond physiologically, biochemically and psychologically to movement. We are also built to be stimulated by -- and respond to -- novelty (write something here in relation to attention economy). A by-product of these stimuli is chronic stillness, or staticity. Needs something here about camera/screen -- and identity.  _Moving Camera Bodies_ 


is ACA’s discussion of “back space” (pp.98-99) (and Bonnie’s BMC work — CQs) useful here?

"[Heidegger] suggests that modern technology is not simply a tool or instrument, but a pervasive cultural epistemological paradigm."[@kolcio_somatic_2005 p.110] - then look into enframing.

CL _And what for me is important is that although the camera overemphasizes the importance of the visual, the other senses are present in the use of the visual as it is not just the eyes who records but the whole body. So I think the research in that way is about how we see with all of our body not just the eyes which goes with expanding the corporeal possibilities of human-smartphone experiences._

between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and understand experiences of movement. There is tension here 

Its screen (device as screen) is also a lens. Turned back on ourselves (third-person perspective). Device as screen, device as lens. 


distinguish from the smartphone as object that conveys information, but rather as a physical oculo-centric device that we are physically connected to (that we hold, swipe) -- that we manage through gesture, posture.

Quantitative and qualitative research on smartphones and our _embodied lives_ has focused on the idea of the quantified self,[@lupton_quantified_2016] and the ways in which "Smartphone Sensing Methods" are able to track social behaviours, physical activity and mobility patterns.[@harari_smartphone_2017] 

focus on "narrating the experience of users"[@galloway_paucity_2020 n.pag.] -- as in the work of Turkle.



CL: _It might be useful to clarify that what is also of interests in this project is the fact that with the smartphone we have a portable camera on us all the time that can record everything we see and that can record us and what we do and share it with others. As well as being a portable camera it is also a mobile computer and phone so the camera and images become a direct way to communicate with each other than just talking or writing._ 

>In particular, people using a cell phone may be less likely to notice new and distinctive stimuli, a phenomenon known as inattentional blindness (Becklen & Cervone, 1983; Mack & Rock, 1998; Neisser & Becklen, 1975; Newby & Rock, 1998; Simons, 2000; Simons & Chabris, 1999).[@hyman_did_2009 p.598]

>We found that individuals walking while talking on a cell phone displayed inattentional blindness in a real-world situation. They experienced more difficulty navigating through a complex environment than people in other conditions. They walked slower, weaved more often, and made more direction changes. Finally, they were less likely to acknowledge other individuals and to notice the unicycling clown thus illustrating inattentional blindness.[@hyman_did_2009 p.604]

>One of the most dangerous aspects of cell phone divided attention is that affected individuals remain oblivious to their poor performance. Strayer et al. (2006) reported that cell phone participants were unaware of the conversation’s detrimental effects because the participants felt that they performed fine even though they had just displayed problems (see also Lesch & Hancock, 2004). Similarly, many individuals with whom we have talked feel they can perform divided attention tasks such as using a cell phone and driving. However, we cannot trust these claims because people are not aware of the things they miss because of inattentional blindness. Simons and Chabris (1999) noted that when participants were shown what they had missed because of inattentional blindness, they were surprised that they could have missed it.[@hyman_did_2009 p.605]  

[^cl1]: _What does the research say on this? And where does it come from, that is to say which discipline, which questions are being asked? I’m not familiar with it myself but depending on its content it could be useful to work with or against it._

are being changed by our use of smartphones, and that these changes are occurring within our capacity to notice them.

Smartphone screens demand attention made possible by chronic stillness, and human bodies are predisposed for movement. _Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research that examines this contradictory situation. The research employs the expertise of dance movement specialists in a series of practical field experiments to examine the ways these contemporary cultural technologies of movement and stillness intersect. The experiments involve applying sensate non-visual movement practices to the hyper-visuality and staticity afforded by the smartphone. The research aims to deepen our understanding of the corporeal inter-relationships between smartphones, vision, proprioception, movement and stillness.

The smartphone is also more than a technological extension to our body. That is, it is more than something that allows “human beings to see, touch, feel, hear, manipulate and understand what to date has remained invisible to the senses or hidden in matter, the body and the universe”.[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5]
