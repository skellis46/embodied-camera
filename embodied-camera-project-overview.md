## project summary

_aim:_ to explore how smartphones are changing human understanding and experiences of animate movement 

_context:_

We are glued to our screens. The smart-phone is now the _sine qua non_ technological extension to our body.[^ext] Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our bodies,[^ch] postures, gestures and movements (add refs for all of these). 




Movement specialists – like dancers – train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture. Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. 

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection between the margins of understanding experiences of movement and the centre of our technological lives: between the body and data; between our flesh and our smartphone objects made from rare and common earth elements and plastics. 

Friction (?) between the bodies of movement specialists (like dancers) --  – and devices that are screens. Collision.

- (visual) anthropology

problem: something about nature of animate movement. changing nature of movement experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as objects and our moving bodies. 


rationale: 

_research areas:_

- primacy of movement v embodiment 
- dance's relationship to movement: the specialists or outliers
- rise of the smartphone
- screens and our lives 
- experiments with cameras and movement
- similar research: Sobchack? 


## research design and methodology

- literature/field review and analysis 
- fieldwork
    + ethnographic interviews on subject of smartphones and our moving bodies 
    + experimental workshops as research space/environment
    + experimental practice-research (with KM, OB, NB, CL): experiments in screen-based anti/non/-movement


outputs:

- visual essay
- experimental film
- journal article
- website
- annotate bibliography: 40-80 key references

We are connected to the visual.
Our cameras are with us.
The mobile phone has gone from being a phone to being a camera with communication functions (Apple keynotes focus on camera upgrades)
Democratization of the moving (and still) image. 
Role of YouTube -- give some sense of its scale and breadth.
Akin to extension of human body. Like Stelarc's experiments and experiences writ large. Volume 5 in JDSP on dance and technology useful here (see Davidson's introduction for overview). 
Frontal embodiment: occular-centric, frontal surfaces of the body. Narrowing of attention towards the central experiences of the eyes (not peripheral)
Attenuation of peripheral vision/experience. Cooper-Albright discusses this in her wee book.
What do I mean by embodiment?
Humans clearly have complex – love-hate – relationship with the smartphone.
Glued to our screens.
