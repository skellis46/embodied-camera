aim: 

context:

We are glued to our screens. The smart-phone is now the sine qua non technological extension to our body.[^ext] Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our bodies,[^ch] our postures, gestures and activities (add refs for all of these). 

The concept of embodiment is ... 
In dance and other somatic practices embodiment refers to ... Movement specialists – like dancers – train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture. Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. 
speculative
an experiment located at the intersection between the margins of embodied understanding and the centre of our technological lives. Between the body and data. Between flesh and these objects-devices made from rare and common earth elements and plastics. 

Friction (?) between the bodies of movement specialists (like dancers) --  – and devices that are screens. Collision.

problem: something about nature of embodiment.


rationale: 

research areas:

methods:
- literature/field review and analysis 
- fieldwork
    + workshops as research space/environment
    + practice-research (with KM, OB, NB): experiments in screen-based disembodiment
    + ethnographic interviews on subject of moving with a smartphone

outputs:

- visual essay
- journal article
- 

We are connected to the visual.
Our cameras are with us.
The mobile phone has gone from being a phone to being a camera with communication functions (Apple keynotes focus on camera upgrades)
Democratization of the moving (and still) image. 
Role of YouTube -- give some sense of its scale and breadth.
Akin to extension of human body. Like Stelarc's experiments and experiences writ large. 
Frontal embodiment: occular-centric, frontal surfaces of the body. Narrowing of attention towards the central experiences of the eyes (not peripheral)
Attenuation of peripheral vision/experience.
What do I mean by embodiment?
Humans clearly have complex – love-hate – relationship with the smartphone.
Glued to our screens.
