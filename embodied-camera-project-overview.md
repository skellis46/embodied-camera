## project summary

_aim:_ to explore how smartphones are changing human understanding and experiences of embodiment 

_context:_

We are glued to our screens. The smart-phone is now the _sine qua non_ technological extension to our body.[^ext] Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our bodies,[^ch] postures, gestures and movements (add refs for all of these). 

The concept of embodiment is ... 
In dance and other somatic practices embodiment refers to ... Movement specialists – like dancers – train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture. Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. 

_Embodied Camera_ is speculative research located at the intersection between the margins of embodied understanding and the centre of our technological lives: between the body and data; between our flesh and our smartphone objects made from rare and common earth elements and plastics. 

Friction (?) between the bodies of movement specialists (like dancers) --  – and devices that are screens. Collision.

- (visual) anthropology

problem: something about nature of embodiment. changing nature of embodiment. to understand or assay the changes in embodiment.

research areas:

## research design and methodology

- literature/field review and analysis 
- fieldwork
    + ethnographic interviews on subject of smartphones and embodiment
    + experimental workshops as research space/environment
    + experimental practice-research (with KM, OB, NB): experiments in screen-based dis/embodiment


outputs:

- visual essay
- experimental film
- journal article
- website
- annotate bibliography: 40 key references

We are connected to the visual.
Our cameras are with us.
The mobile phone has gone from being a phone to being a camera with communication functions (Apple keynotes focus on camera upgrades)
Democratization of the moving (and still) image. 
Role of YouTube -- give some sense of its scale and breadth.
Akin to extension of human body. Like Stelarc's experiments and experiences writ large. 
Frontal embodiment: occular-centric, frontal surfaces of the body. Narrowing of attention towards the central experiences of the eyes (not peripheral)
Attenuation of peripheral vision/experience.
What do I mean by embodiment?
Humans clearly have complex – love-hate – relationship with the smartphone.
Glued to our screens.
