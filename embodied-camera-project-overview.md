## project summary

### aims 

- to use experimental dance practices to explore how smartphones are changing human experiences of movement, posture and gesture
- to better understand the ways in which the smartphone limits and affords possibilities for movement
- 

### context

We are glued to our screens. The smart-phone is now the _sine qua non_ technological extension to our body.[^ext] Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our bodies,[^ch] postures, gestures and movements (add refs for all of these). 

But rather than being a technological extension ...

>technologies that extend perception, allowing human beings to see, touch, feel, hear, manipulate and understand what to date has remained invisible to the senses or hidden in matter, the body and the universe. [@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5] 
- am I describing or imagining the limits of tech? the directionality of this quote is odd in context of this research


Movement specialists – like dancers – train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture. Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. 

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection between the margins of understanding experiences of movement and the centre of our technological lives: between the body and data; between our flesh and our smartphone objects made from rare and common earth elements and plastics. 

Friction (?) between the bodies of movement specialists (like dancers) --  – and devices that are screens. Collision.

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as objects and our moving bodies. 

We are connected to the visual.
Our cameras are with us.
The mobile phone has gone from being a phone to being a camera with communication functions (Apple keynotes focus on camera upgrades)
Democratization of the moving (and still) image. 
Role of YouTube -- give some sense of its scale and breadth.
Akin to extension of human body. Like Stelarc's experiments and experiences writ large. Volume 5 in JDSP on dance and technology useful here (see Davidson's introduction for overview). 
Frontal embodiment: occular-centric, frontal surfaces of the body. Narrowing of attention towards the central experiences of the eyes (not peripheral)
Attenuation of peripheral vision/experience. Cooper-Albright discusses this in her wee book.
What do I mean by embodiment?
Humans clearly have complex – love-hate – relationship with the smartphone.
Glued to our screens.

### research areas

- the rise of the smartphone
- screens and our lives 
- previous research (through practice and theory)
    + sociology and psychology
    + philosophy
        * Sobchack
    + visual anthropology?
    + dance and technology
    + art
        * sculptures of hands as smartphone gestures 
    + experiments with cameras and movement
        * We Record Ourselves
- theoretical frame
    + Sheets-Johnstone: primacy of movement v embodiment 
    + Ingold: Making
- dance's relationship to movement: the specialists or outliers


## research design and methodology

### objectives

- generate series of physical-movement experiments at intersection of the body and the smartphone
- create online resource that collates scholarship (and news reporting) about relationship between smartphones and our bodies
- employ dance practices as a strategy to expand understanding of the role and impact of smartphone screens on daily life
- create and share conversations with industry and disciplinary experts about our bodies and our smartphones 
- develop range of public facing (including non-traditional) research outputs
- develop various writing practices (blog posting and traditional scholarship) that shares key (emergent) ideas and communicates research understandings 

### methods

- literature/field review and analysis 
- fieldwork
    + ethnographic interviews on subject of smartphones and our moving bodies (with artists and scholars)
        * artist who made scultures of hands (gestures)
    + experimental workshops as research space/environment
    + experimental practice-research (with KM, OB, NB, CL): experiments in screen-based anti/non/-movement
- rationale: why this method? what do we get from it? 
    + experiential 
    + understanding through doing (citation/evidence/precedent)
    + what we 'know' through dance pratices (ie what dance understand might bring to the project)

### outcomes

- visual essay
- experimental film (with K, O and N)
- journal article
- website
- annotated bibliography: 40-80 key references
