## project summary

_aim:_ to explore how smartphones are changing human understanding and experiences of animate movement 

_context:_

We are glued to our screens. The smart-phone is now the _sine qua non_ technological extension to our body.[^ext] Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our bodies,[^ch] postures, gestures and movements (add refs for all of these). 


In dance scholarship we seem to use the verb _to embody_ rather loosely and confusingly. Of the various definitions in the OED---and putting aside some of the military-oriented etymologies as in "the number of embodied troops" from 1803---the closest to our common use seems to be "to put into a body" or "invest or clothe (a spirit) with a body".[@noauthor_embody_2019] A soul or spirit is embodied when it has a body or is "invested with a body"[@noauthor_embodied_2019] Perhaps this suggests a process of holding or containing in the body something that is not normally thought of as being of the body. And so when we (dance scholars) use the phrase "embodied knowledge" perhaps we are simply drawing attention to a form of understanding that is distinct from common understandings of knowledge, and that is _held_ in the body. The same with embodied intelligence, and even embodied awareness. 

But what about _embodied actions_ or _embodied movements_ or even _embodied dance_? These are all terms common in dance practice and scholarship. Actions, movements and dance are concepts that are already primarily corporeal, at least in their common usage. It's as if in these examples the word _embodied_ acts as an adjectival modifier to help make the nouns more specific, not unlike _fast_ or _hot_ or _sexy_. As in fast actions, hot movements and sexy dance. But with _embodied_ as a modifier of human action this does not seem quite right. I suspect that when we describe an action as _embodied_ we are ascribing some quality of attention or awareness to that action. That such embodied actions are not trivially placed on the outside of the body, but rather invested deeply within the body. The question of how it is that we might recognise embodied actions over what I could call _disembodied actions_ is an entirely different problem. (Sheets-Johnston 2011 discusses disembodiment)

Add how Ingold refutes this idea of 'holding'. (and Sheets-Johnstone)

>In a pivotally central but also ironic way, “embodied minds,” like other current “embodiments,” serve reductionist interests and goals, occluding the reality of mindful bodies. [@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.501]

>Serious examination of such affirmations and proclamations on behalf of “embodiment” shows that the term is little more than a lexical band-aid covering a [p.311] three-hundred year old Western wound. In using the term, we are actually perpetuating a divide that has not healed and will never heal so long as the terms of the division remain part of our thinking. They remain part of our thinking because we have not yet fathomed what it is to be the bodies we are.[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.310]

>To unmuddle our thinking, we must go back to everyday human experience. Thus, with respect to embodiment, we must ask ourselves not only what it is that is embodied and challenge ourselves to describe it, but ask ourselves how it is embodied and challenge ourselves to describe in experiential terms just how the what we believe to be embodied — a mind, a soul, a spirit, a self, our organism, or whatever — is embodied by the body.[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.312]

>When we have recourse to “embodiment,” we avoid coming to terms with bodies, with what is actually there, sensuously present in our experience, precisely as with the experience of moving and changing shape — or with the experience of a front and a back and of moving more easily forward than backward.[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.312]

>speak of “embodied movement” in an attempt to specify the relationship between affect and movement (Varela & Depraz 2005:68, 69, respectively). The latter locution, we should note, is an epistemological tautology of the first order. It highlights the basic challenge of languaging experience.[@sheets-johnstone_primacy_2011 p.470]



Here are two examples of just how much dance scholars are prepared to tie themselves in knots making sense of _embodied knowledge_:

>the somatic intelligence is prioritized as the main tool in this research process. As one of the forms of the physical intelligence, it is an experiential corporal modality, a form of embodied knowledge that can be described as an increased skill to sense, to perceive and to relate. [@choiniere_somatic/embodiment/technology_2018 p.195]

Choiniere is saying that somatic intelligence is like embodied knowledge _and_ is a subset of physical intelligence. Three abstract terms in one sentence that each seem to refer to each other (in however )

three abstract terms in one sentence 
?
I don't get the 'increased' bit. 
what are the other forms? 
to sense what? to perceive what?
to relate to whom or what?


>For dance practitioners, somatic intelligence constitutes a model of corporeal experience: a form of embodied knowledge that can also be described as a skill for sensing, relating and ‘revealing’.[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.6]

Movement specialists – like dancers – train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture. Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. 

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection between the margins of understanding experiences of movement and the centre of our technological lives: between the body and data; between our flesh and our smartphone objects made from rare and common earth elements and plastics. 

Friction (?) between the bodies of movement specialists (like dancers) --  – and devices that are screens. Collision.

- (visual) anthropology

problem: something about nature of animate movement. changing nature of movement experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as objects and our moving bodies. 


rationale: 

_research areas:_

- primacy of movement v embodiment 
- dance's relationship to movement: the specialists or outliers
- rise of the smartphone
- screens and our lives 
- experiments with cameras and movement
- similar research: Sobchack? 


## research design and methodology

- literature/field review and analysis 
- fieldwork
    + ethnographic interviews on subject of smartphones and our moving bodies 
    + experimental workshops as research space/environment
    + experimental practice-research (with KM, OB, NB, CL): experiments in screen-based anti/non/-movement


outputs:

- visual essay
- experimental film
- journal article
- website
- annotate bibliography: 40-80 key references

We are connected to the visual.
Our cameras are with us.
The mobile phone has gone from being a phone to being a camera with communication functions (Apple keynotes focus on camera upgrades)
Democratization of the moving (and still) image. 
Role of YouTube -- give some sense of its scale and breadth.
Akin to extension of human body. Like Stelarc's experiments and experiences writ large. Volume 5 in JDSP on dance and technology useful here (see Davidson's introduction for overview). 
Frontal embodiment: occular-centric, frontal surfaces of the body. Narrowing of attention towards the central experiences of the eyes (not peripheral)
Attenuation of peripheral vision/experience. Cooper-Albright discusses this in her wee book.
What do I mean by embodiment?
Humans clearly have complex – love-hate – relationship with the smartphone.
Glued to our screens.
