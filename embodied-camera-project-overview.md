# project overview: moving camera bodies

## brief summary: moving camera bodies 

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection of our bodies and our smart-phones: between the device that has become the centre of our technological lives, and our capacity to sense and understand experiences of movement; between hyper-visuality and the sensate or felt; between our flesh and our device-objects; between the body and data.

We are glued to our screens. The smart-phone is now the _sine qua non_ technological extension to our body. Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our bodies, postures, gestures and movements. The smart-phone is also more than a technological extension to our body. That is, it is more than something that allows "human beings to see, touch, feel, hear, manipulate and understand what to date has remained invisible to the senses or hidden in matter, the body and the universe".[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5] If bodily technologies commonly and historically extend our senses outwards -- centrifugally -- then the smart-phone seems to direct our attention back towards our selves in a more centripetal (or centre-seeking) manner. The smart-phone -- a device characterised by, or synonymous with, its screen -- is both lens and mirror. 

Movement specialists like dancers train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture. Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. At the heart of their work is the desire and capacity to sense and feel the body from the inside through proprioception and kinaesthetic awareness. This _sensate acuity_ is the hallmark of somatic practices like Alexander Technique, Feldenkrais and Skinner Releasing Technique.

### context

We are glued to our screens. The smart-phone is now the _sine qua non_ technological extension to our body.[^ext] Greeted with pleasure, scepticism, angst and joy, it is changing our bodies,[^ch] postures, gestures and movements (add refs for all of these). 

The smart-phone is also more than a technological extension to our body. That is, it is more than something that allows "human beings to see, touch, feel, hear, manipulate and understand what to date has remained invisible to the senses or hidden in matter, the body and the universe".[@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5] If historically conventional corporeal technological extensions extend our senses outwards -- centrifugally -- then the smart-phone seems to direct our attention back towards our selves in a more centripetal (or centre-seeking) manner. The smart-phone -- a device characterised by or synonymous with its screen -- is both lens and mirror. 

Its screen (device as screen) is also a lens. Turned back on ourselves (third-person perspective). Device as screen, device as lens. 

Tension between hyper-visuality, and the sensate or felt. 

Movement specialists like dancers train the body-mind towards sensitivity, attention, listening, and recognising change, posture, alignment and gesture. Dancers are corporeal outliers. They represent the margins or (cutting) edge of the human capacity to be sensitive to our bodies. Sensing from the inside. (distinct from seeing from the outside with a smart-phone)

_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection between the margins of understanding experiences of movement and the centre of our technological lives: between the body and data; between our flesh and our smart-phone objects made from rare and common earth elements and plastics. 

Friction (?) between the bodies of movement specialists (like dancers) --  and devices that are screens. Collision.





We are connected to the visual.
Our cameras are with us.
The mobile phone has gone from being a phone to being a camera with communication functions (Apple keynotes focus on camera upgrades)
Democratization of the moving (and still) image. 
Role of YouTube -- give some sense of its scale and breadth.
Akin to extension of human body. Like Stelarc's experiments and experiences writ large. Volume 5 in JDSP on dance and technology useful here (see Davidson's introduction for overview). 
Frontal embodiment: occular-centric, frontal surfaces of the body. Narrowing of attention towards the central experiences of the eyes (not peripheral)
Attenuation of peripheral vision/experience. Cooper-Albright discusses this in her wee book.
What do I mean by embodiment?
Humans clearly have complex love-hate relationship with the smart-phone.
Glued to our screens.

### problem 

Our bodies are built for movement. Human beings -- and the bodies we inhabit -- respond physiologically, biochemically and psychologically to movement. We are also built to be stimulated by -- and respond to -- novelty (write something here in relation to attention economy). A by-product of these stimuli is chronic stillness, or staticity. Needs something here about camera/screen -- and identity.  _Moving Camera Bodies_ 

problem: something about changing nature of movement and postural experiences. to understand or assay changes at the intersection of devices as camera-objects and our bodies that are built for movement. 
problem: to investigate this friction. The friction is cultural; the friction is contemporary; the friction is taking over the world. 

In _Moving Camera Bodies_ we apply a physical and sensate -- and thereby mostly unseeing -- lens to hyper-visuality and staticity as expressed through and afforded by the smart-phone.


## research design and methodology

### aim

- to employ the skills, experiences and expertise of dance artist-researchers as 'tools' for speculative exploration into _human experiences with everyday technology_
- to adapt and use experimental movement practices to examine the ways in which the smart-phone limits and affords possibilities for movement, sensing and seeing
- to imagine and communicate new or different body-based relationships to the smart-phone 
- employ dance and somatic practices as a strategy to expand understanding of the role and impact of smart-phone screens on daily life

### research questions and their objectives

1. How does it feel somatically -- in our bodies -- to use a smart-phone? 
    
+ analysis of literature examining impact of smart-phone use with and on our bodies
+ ethnographic interviews with four dancers/movement experts exploring their felt experiences of using smart-phones
+ analysis of transcriptions from interviews to tease out key themes 
+ upload interview transcriptions online as OA resource
+ develop scholarly article that shares and juxtaposes key themes from interviews with key ideas from previous scholarship about relationship between smart-phones and our bodies

2. What movements, postures, gestures and physical _attitudes_ does the smart-phone limit and afford? What types of experiences are generated when the smart-phone and its camera are consciously used to inform, disrupt and complicate the corporeal-sensorial possibilities of the body? 

+ complete practice-research fieldwork to create lexicon of body-based limits and affordances in relation to smart-phone 
+ use practice-research to experiment with the smart-phone and its camera as a source for body-based understandings and experiences
+ transcribe/record these experiments and share online

3. How can movement and somatic practices be adapted and used to generate novel or alternate bodily patterns or habits in relationship to the smartphone? 

+ use practice-research fieldwork to generate series of practices that sensitise our bodies to the smart-phone
+ use practice-research fieldwork to create a set of body-based 'activities' that up-end our moving and bodily relationship to the smart-phone

4. The smartphone is both camera (lens) and mirror. We see ourselves and others through and in it. How might this dominant and physically restricted cultural way of _seeing_ be adapted and reconfigured through somatic practices that privilege non-visual senses?

+ examine current cross-disciplinary scholarship (anthropology, sociology, psychology, somatic practices, visual culture) to reveal key ideas at the intersection of oculo-centric habitus, photo-visual culture, and non-visual senses (haptic, kinesthetic, proprioceptive, aural)
+ use creative practice-research experimentation to examine the friction or tension generated by using sensate (or body-based 'felt') strategies to explore the hyper-visuality of smart-phone culture

### outcomes 

- develop range of public facing (including non-traditional) research outputs
- develop various writing practices (blog posting and traditional scholarship) that share key (emergent) ideas and communicate research understandings 
- something about aesthetic, process-orientated (through creative practice), experiential and ethnographic 

1. Develop (ready for publication) a scholarly article examining how it feels to use a smart-phone
2. _smart-phone and its camera's effects on the body:_ create annotated video lexicon of body gestures, actions and possibilities that are limited or afforded by the smart-phone and its camera (use MotionBank?). This collection will be recorded, transcribed, organised and uploaded to project website
3. _body's effects on the camera:_ generate a series of body-based practices or activities that question, expand and transform our conventional corporeal relationship to the smart-phone. This collection will be recorded, transcribed, organised and uploaded to the project website
4. artistic output - screendance (coming from RQ 2 and 3)
5. non-visual senses. creative possibilities of device as camera and the body (intersection) possibly use footage or stills from interviews as well? - visual essay
6. project website, including project blog

### methods

- break down according to research questions
- 
- literature/field review and analysis 
- fieldwork
    + ethnographic interviews on subject of smart-phones and our moving bodies (with artists and scholars)
        * artist who made sculptures of hands (gestures)
    + experimental workshops as research space/environment
    + experimental practice-research (with KM, OB, NB, CL): 
        * experiments in screen-based anti/non/-movement
        * combining first-person and third-person cameras (phone and go-pro mounted with gnarwhal)
- rationale: why this method? what do we get from it? 
    + experiential 
    + understanding through doing (citation/evidence/precedent)
    + what we 'know' through dance practices (ie what dance understand might bring to the project)

# edit bin

+ generate a series of physical-movement experiments at intersection of the sensing-moving-body and the smart-phone

- use experimental creative practices and ethnography to critically examine sensory experiences of the smart-phone device (including non-visual): haptic, kinesthetic, aural ...
- something about peripheral experiences

+ apply experimental movement practices to examine our dis/embodied relationship to the smart-phone

+ create and share conversations with industry and disciplinary experts about our bodies and our smart-phones 

That is, what bodily experiences -- postural and gestural _attitudes_ -- are typical when we use a smart-phone? 

- create speculative opportunities to re-think and re-understand our physical relationship to the smart-phone


explore how smart-phones are changing human experiences of movement, posture and gesture
