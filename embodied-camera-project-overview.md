## project summary

### context


_Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research located at the intersection between the margins of understanding experiences of movement and the centre of our technological lives: between the body and data; between our flesh and our smart-phone objects made from rare and common earth elements and plastics. 


We are connected to the visual.
Our cameras are with us.
The mobile phone has gone from being a phone to being a camera with communication functions (Apple keynotes focus on camera upgrades)
Democratization of the moving (and still) image. 
Role of YouTube -- give some sense of its scale and breadth.
Akin to extension of human body. Like Stelarc's experiments and experiences writ large. Volume 5 in JDSP on dance and technology useful here (see Davidson's introduction for overview). 
Frontal embodiment: occular-centric, frontal surfaces of the body. Narrowing of attention towards the central experiences of the eyes (not peripheral)
Attenuation of peripheral vision/experience. Cooper-Albright discusses this in her wee book.
What do I mean by embodiment?
Humans clearly have complex love-hate relationship with the smart-phone.
Glued to our screens.

Friction (?) between the bodies of movement specialists (like dancers) --  and devices that are screens. Collision.


+ generate a series of physical-movement experiments at intersection of the sensing-moving-body and the smart-phone

- use experimental creative practices and ethnography to critically examine sensory experiences of the smart-phone device (including non-visual): haptic, kinesthetic, aural ...
- something about peripheral experiences

+ apply experimental movement practices to examine our dis/embodied relationship to the smart-phone

+ create and share conversations with industry and disciplinary experts about our bodies and our smart-phones 

That is, what bodily experiences -- postural and gestural _attitudes_ -- are typical when we use a smart-phone? 

- create speculative opportunities to re-think and re-understand our physical relationship to the smart-phone


explore how smart-phones are changing human experiences of movement, posture and gesture
