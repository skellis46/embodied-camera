# Leverhulme Trust research project grants: _moving camera bodies_ (working title)

## abstract

There is growing evidence that our physical and psychological well-being is compromised by overuse of smartphones. These compromises are underpinned by a paradox: human bodies are predisposed for movement, while smartphone screens demand attention made possible by chronic stillness. _Moving Camera Bodies_ is speculative research that aims to examine how our bodies and smartphones currently meet and effect each other, and to experiment with how they _might_ meet and effect each other. It will use the expertise of dance movement specialists to develop practical field experiments that explore these contradictory cultural technologies and experiences: the body that needs movement, and the smartphone that demands stillness and attention. The research will then use auto-ethnographic methods to analyse the practice-based experiments, and thereby deepen our understanding of the corporeal inter-relationships between smartphones, vision, proprioception, movement and stillness.

## research design 

### aim

To examine how our bodies and smartphones currently meet and effect each other, and to imagine new possibilities for how they _might_ meet and effect each other.

- not sure about the word "meet" here (and "interact" is not right -- or would make people think of interactivity)


### questions (RQ)

1. _Feeling:_ How does it feel in our bodies -- somatically -- to use a smartphone? 
2. _Limits and affordances:_ How are movements, postures, gestures and physical experiences limited or facilitated by smartphones? What types of physical experiences are generated when the smartphone and its camera are consciously used to inform, disrupt and complicate the corporeal-sensorial possibilities of the body? 
3. _Adaptation and generation:_ How can movement and somatic practices be adapted and used to generate novel or alternate bodily patterns or habits in relationship to the smartphone? 
4. _Non-visual senses:_ The smartphone is both camera (lens) and mirror. We see ourselves and others through and in it. How might this dominant and physically limited way of _seeing_ be adapted and reconfigured through somatic practices that privilege non-visual senses?


### objectives

_RQ1 Feeling:_

1. generate ethnographic data from movement specialists that create a vocabulary exploring how it feels to use a smartphone
2. survey current sociological literature that examines experiences of smartphone use

_RQ2 Limits and affordances:_

3. create a series of artistic research practices that use the smartphone and its camera to explore and test bodily-sensorial limits and affordances
4. create audio-visual documentation of these practice-based practices and share online 
5. develop reflective-analytical document that describes the physical experiences (limits and affordances) generated in the practices

_RQ3 Adaptation and Generation:_

6. generate a series of artistic research somatic practices that sensitise our bodies to the smartphone
7. create a set of body-based somatic 'activities' that up-end our moving and bodily relationship to the smartphone
8. create audio-visual documentation of these practice-based experiments and share online
9. develop reflective-analytical document that describes the effects of the experimental somatic practices on our corporeal relationship to the smartphone

_RQ4 Non-visual senses:_

10. examine current cross-disciplinary scholarship (anthropology, sociology, psychology, somatic practices, visual culture) to reveal key ideas at the intersection of oculo-centric habitus, photo-visual culture, and non-visual senses (haptic, kinesthetic, proprioceptive, aural)
11. generate a set of artistic research experiments that explore the tension between sensate strategies (e.g. body-based or 'felt' movement practices) and the hyper-visuality of smartphones
12. create audio-visual documentation of these practice-based experiments and share online
13. develop reflective-analytical document that explores the intersection of non-visual (corporeal) senses and hyper-visuality

### methods

- thoughts on building visual anthropological methods here?

_RQ1 Feeling:_

- ethnographic interviews and analysis with four dancers/movement experts exploring their felt experiences of using smartphones
- literature analysis


_RQ2 Limits and affordances:_

- artistic research (practice-research) fieldwork
- auto-ethnographic reflections/analysis of the fieldwork experiments
- audio-visual documentation

_RQ3 Adaptation and generation:_

- artistic research (practice-research) fieldwork
- auto-ethnographic reflections/analysis of the fieldwork experiments
- audio-visual documentation

_RQ4 Non-visual senses:_

- survey and analysis of cross-disciplinary scholarship
- artistic research (practice-research) fieldwork
- auto-ethnographic reflections/analysis of the fieldwork experiments
- audio-visual documentation


### planned outputs (possible)

_notes:_

- develop range of public facing (including non-traditional) research outputs
- develop various writing practices (blog posting and traditional scholarship) that share key (emergent) ideas and communicate research understandings 
- something about aesthetic, process-orientated (through creative practice), experiential and ethnographic 


1. scholarly article that shares and juxtaposes key themes from interviews with key ideas from previous scholarship about relationship between smartphones and our bodies (_RQ1 feeling_)
2. annotated video lexicon of body gestures, movements and actions that are limited or afforded by the smartphone and its camera. This collection will be recorded, transcribed, organised and uploaded to project website (_RQ2 Limits and affordances_)
3. audio-visual document of body-based practices or activities that question, expand and transform our conventional corporeal relationship to the smartphone. The practices will be recorded, transcribed, organised and uploaded to the project website (_RQ3 Adaptation and generation_)
4. experimental film or "screendance" developed from practices in _RQ2_ and _RQ3_
5. video essay that examines the non-visual and visual binary central to the body-smartphone paradox (_RQ4 Non-visual senses_))
6. project website, project blog (_RQ1-4_)
