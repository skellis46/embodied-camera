## 20200212 - research with technology

>From this perspective, sensoriality reorganizes itself and interiority is mediated, for this same interiority is constantly changing and evolves with respect to the destabilization created by an external technological agency. This modification of interiority through mediation allows for a renewal of the perception of movement and specifically, of the body moving through space. It is one of the elements that allows one to avoid the sclerosis that characterizes much choreography (Bernard 2001) and in my view, constitutes one of the most important aspects of research with technology: the renewal of perceptual organization in order to create new movement scores.

## 20200212 - technology as tangible other in artistic processes

>Technology places a tangible other in the artistic process through which the experience of the body can be reflected upon, integrated into new systems of organization, and newly understood. [@ashley_embodiment_2016 p.5]

- common thought is that technology is integrated. That technology intervenes in what is happening.
- but what seems different with smartphones is that it's hard to think of them any more as an intervention or something imposing themselves on our lives. It is more that their victory is complete. That somehow our lives are the things that are intervening in their presence. But this also depends on whether I approach them as simple objects (as opposed to devices). Could go from both perspectives: device and object -- and what this dual-perspective affords.

## 20200124 - Leverhulme approach to grant making

assessment criteria: [leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/our-approach-grant-making](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/our-approach-grant-making)

- Originality – the research achieves more than the incremental development of a single discipline
- Importance – the work will enable further research or enquiry
- Significance – the proposed research has relevance outside a single field, and is able to excite those working in other disciplines
- Merit – the quality of the research design and methodology, and the suitability of the researchers and institution for the realisation of the proposed research objectives

### Secondary criteria

- reflect an individual’s personal vision, aspiration, or intellectual curiosity
- take appropriate risks in setting and pursuing research objectives
- enable a refreshing departure from established patterns of working – either for the individual, or for the discipline
- transcend disciplinary boundaries
