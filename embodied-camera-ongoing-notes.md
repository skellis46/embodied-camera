## 20200327 - embodied film - hopkins

>In the same way that photography’s new way of seeing at the end of the nineteenth century led to a letting go of some deeply held visual preconceptions, and at the end of the twentieth century digital cameras invited us to continue that journey, for filmmakers Prapto’s _empty axis_ suggests a letting go on both physical and cultural levels, with many implications for narrative and structure, the physical use of the body in filming, and the place of mind. Together, these require a [p.18] radical openness that remains physically connected but is not seduced by the visual sense or intellectualised.[@hopkins_eye_2014 pp.17-18]

- thinking through the visual and the perceptual/felt -- that in the phone both are powerfully afforded

## 20200325 - films to explore

came out of conversations in Findhorn in 2019:

- Lick and the dogs
- The Fall - Tarsem Singh
- The Color of Pomegranate
- Steve McQueen - film from Keaton
- Hyperallergic
- Mark Cousins -- video essays
- Catherine Grant -- video essays

other notes from those same conversations

Solloway: 3 ways of using a camera:
1. I, feel, see
2. I see how it feels to be seen
3. I see you seeing me
- Katrina’s rethinking of that.

- camera on body, attached, held, away
- on bungee
- throwing the camera 
- “agency of the image” - Katrina
- how important is the camera in what is being filmed?
- when the subject is more important than the camera it is documentation? (ACA)
- “space of movement, moving image and bodies” -- ACA
- the way our bodies are prescribed

## 20200305 - 3rd person perspective

>Since a centrifugal mode of perception is standard for a human subject, the user has no point of reference for understanding the world as seen through the eyes of a centripetally perceiving camera.[@bedard_disembodied_2015 p.12]

>In time, I suspect our experience of centripetal images in GoPro videos will begin to influence our own perceptual apparatus and allow us to view and interact differently with the world around us. Among other changes this might foster, we might learn to understand how differently the world can be seen from outside our typical, centrifugal mode of perception.[@bedard_disembodied_2015 p.12]

- we create a similar (if not as fixed) 3rd person relationship with camera with the smartphone -- it is peering at us in this way. Bedard touches on this in the next page -- in a thought experiment

## 20200227 - identification

>Through the terms they use, Schmidt and Thompson evoke the process of identification, which, as for instance Katherine Thomson- Jones explains, is central to our understanding and our appreciation of narrative films since it “explains why we enjoy watching films” (115), constituting “one of the primary ways in which we engage with characters” (105). Although the images discussed in this article are taken from extreme-sports videos rather than narrative films, I argue a similar process of immersion and identification still takes place. While some theorists treat identification as “pathological and thus undesirable and dangerous” (Thompson-Jones 136), this article considers identification with the athletes on screen to be a positive act of emotional and visceral engagement between a viewer and what he or she sees; a process that can be beneficial to the experience of these videos. With this in mind, it is important that a first- person camera placement, such as the one Schmidt and Thompson describe, offers the viewer a taste of what it feels like to do what these athletes do.

## 20200220 - Ingold on embodiment

>Every living organism, like the musselled Moore, is itself a site of infestation: a seething colony of lively, jostling materials alternately compressed into blobs and stretched into filaments that twist and coil around one another to form configurations of extraordinary complexity. The organism may look outwardly composed. Lift the lid, however, and you find something more like a compost heap than the formal architecture that anatomists and psychologists like to imagine. Indeed as a gathering together of materials in movement, the organism fully qualifies as a thing in the sense outlined in the last chapter. But it is not a thing that moves; it is rather composed (or better, composted) in movement. This is to say that it is fundamentally animate. Yet for just this reason, it would be wrong to describe it as embodied. It would be hard to imagine a figure more embodied, for example, than Moore’s Warrior. The figure is so completely [p.94] wrapped up in itself that any residue of animate life has been stilled. Starling’s Infestation Piece, to the contrary, is animate precisely to the extent that its surfaces have opened up to the surrounding medium. Comparison of the two pieces vividly demonstrates how animacy and embodiment pull in opposite directions: where the former is a movement of opening, the latter is bent on closure. For the living, animate beings we are, argues dance philosopher Maxine Sheets-Johnstone, the term ‘embodiment’ is simply not experientially apposite. We do not, she insists, experience ourselves and one another as ‘packaged’ but as moving and moved, in ongoing response – that is in correspondence – with the things around us (Sheets-Johnstone 1998: 359; Ingold 2011b: 10). Of course we have bodies – indeed we are our bodies. But we are not wrapped up in them. The body is not a package, nor – to invoke another common analogy – a sink into which movements settle like sediment in a ditch.2 It is rather a tumult of unfolding activity. As such, according to dance anthropologist Brenda Farnell, it is something to think from rather than about (Farnell 2000: 413).

## 20200218 - Davidson on resonance

>What are at stake are fundamental differences of logic and modes of expression that have entered our consciousness and multiple practices of communication. Perceptual and cognitive processes – the way we see, process and manipulate information – are radically changing as a result of the digital revolution. Of the two founding theories underpinning the notion of information – ‘resonance’ (Gibson 1950) and ‘redundance’5 (Brillouin 1956) – the former term recognizes the persistence of the body as seat of knowledge. In contrast to ‘redundance’, a term deriving from mathematics and cybernetics, ‘resonance’ heralds from theories of perception and ethology and views information as a field that specifies a context for behaviour. Perception is thus interpreted as the seizing or extraction of pertinent information from within that field (Auray 2002: 131). [@davidson_somatics_2013 p.5]

## 20200212 - research with technology

>From this perspective, sensoriality reorganizes itself and interiority is mediated, for this same interiority is constantly changing and evolves with respect to the destabilization created by an external technological agency. This modification of interiority through mediation allows for a renewal of the perception of movement and specifically, of the body moving through space. It is one of the elements that allows one to avoid the sclerosis that characterizes much choreography (Bernard 2001) and in my view, constitutes one of the most important aspects of research with technology: the renewal of perceptual organization in order to create new movement scores. [@choiniere_for_2013 p.104]

- but it's just never clear what she means by technology. 

## 20200212 - technology as tangible other in artistic processes

>Technology places a tangible other in the artistic process through which the experience of the body can be reflected upon, integrated into new systems of organization, and newly understood. [@ashley_embodiment_2016 p.5]

- common thought is that technology is integrated. That technology intervenes in what is happening.
- but what seems different with smartphones is that it's hard to think of them any more as an intervention or something imposing themselves on our lives. It is more that their victory is complete. That somehow our lives are the things that are intervening in their presence. But this also depends on whether I approach them as simple objects (as opposed to devices). Could go from both perspectives: device and object -- and what this dual-perspective affords.

## 20200124 - Leverhulme approach to grant making

assessment criteria: [leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/our-approach-grant-making](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/funding/our-approach-grant-making)

- Originality – the research achieves more than the incremental development of a single discipline
- Importance – the work will enable further research or enquiry
- Significance – the proposed research has relevance outside a single field, and is able to excite those working in other disciplines
- Merit – the quality of the research design and methodology, and the suitability of the researchers and institution for the realisation of the proposed research objectives

### Secondary criteria

- reflect an individual’s personal vision, aspiration, or intellectual curiosity
- take appropriate risks in setting and pursuing research objectives
- enable a refreshing departure from established patterns of working – either for the individual, or for the discipline
- transcend disciplinary boundaries
